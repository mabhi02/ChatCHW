Place the baby in proper position, dry and cover with a folded towel under the baby\u2019s shoulders. The baby\u2019s head should be slightly extended 2. Place the mask with bag attached over infant\u2019s mouth and nose, and try to make an airtight seal. Proper positioning of bag and mask 3. Squeeze the bag 40 times per minute. 4. Check to see that the baby\u2019s chest rises with each ventilation5. If the chest is not rising\u2022 Reposition the baby\u2019s head and try again\u2022 Reposition the mask and check that the seal does not allow air to escape\u2022 Increase ventilation pressure by squeezing the bag harder\u2022 If there is too mucus, suction again\u2022 If chest is still not rising, remove bag from mask, place mask over baby\u2019s mouth and nose and blow directly into the mask 6. After ventilating for one minute, stop and look for spontaneous cry or breathing. If not present, continue ventilating 7. Every two minutes or 80 breaths, check for a few seconds to see if the baby is responding. Is yes, stop. If no, continue. 8. After 10 minutes of ventilation, if there is no gasping or breathing, stop ventilation. 9. When resuscitation is complete, wash the mask and valve with soap and water, dry, and store in its bag.
