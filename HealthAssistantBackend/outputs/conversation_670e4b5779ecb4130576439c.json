Put on a pair of gloves to prevent the spread of infection.\n2. Ask the patient to lie on their side with their knees bent and feet brought towards their chest.\n3. Gently insert a lubricated finger into the anus, taking care not to cause any discomfort or pain.\n4. Feel for any abnormalities in the rectal tone or masses.\n5. Check for blood in the stool by gently rotating your finger around the inside of the rectal cavity.\n6. Remove your finger and inspect it for any signs of blood or mucus.\n7. Remove your gloves and wash your hands thoroughly.\n\nThis test can help identify if the patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to their symptoms of blood in the stool.",
