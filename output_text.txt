The National Rural Health Mission launched on 12th April 2005, seeks to
provide effective, efficient and affordable health care to rural population ineighteen states with weak public health indicators.
One of the key components of the mission is creating a band of female health
volunteers, appropriately named “Accredited Social Health Activist” (ASHA) ineach village within the identified States.  These ASHAs would act as a ‘bridge’between the rural people and health service outlets and would play a centralrole, in achieving national health and population policy goals.
ASHAs are to be selected by community, out of residents within the community.
They would work on voluntary basis, although compensation would be providedto them for specific activities and services. ASHA guidelines clearly lay downthe accountability mechanisms. The induction training for ASHA would becompleted in 23 days spread in five rounds over a period of 12 months to befollowed by periodic re-training for about two days once every alternate month.
Equipping ASHAs with knowledge and skills required to perform the assigned
roles will be crucial element in the programme. The training programme forPrefacePreface

ASHAs needs to be organised closer to communities.  A major challenge will be
to sustain the interest of selected women participating in the initialtraining programme.
This book is first in the series, to be made available during the entire training
period. Written in simple language, it can be modified, adapted and translatedby respective States as per their needs. The programme managers working inNGO settings may also like to use this book.
I take this opportunity to thank United Nations Population Fund for providing
technical assistance for development of the training materials to be used inASHA programme.

My Eight TasksASHA:My Eight Tasks
KKnnoowwiinngg  oouurr  vviillllaaggee  ppeeooppllee
Improving health status of our people is a teamwork. You require participation
of everyone—the people, the nurse, the anganwadi, the Dai, the schoolteachersand the village Panchayat. You also need the help of doctor. You will need towork with all of them so that people remain healthy.
Village people are not as rich as city people. They have to face many difficulties.
They depend on land and farming. Some of them also work as wage labourers innearby towns. In many villages, rearing cattle is a source of income. Most farmersdepend upon rains. Many work as artisans. They work hard to live their life.
Some people are too poor. They are grouped as below poverty line (BPL) as per
Government criteria. Often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and othermarginalized groups. Families belonging to BPL are eligible for special benefitsunder government schemes. A village may have different settlements fordifferent castes.
Everyone needs health care. Yet some groups of people are vulnerable to sickness.
The poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people needhealth care more often. Their health needs are not adequately met. They havelittle or no money. At times they have to take loans at very high interest rates to
3

PAGE 14

get admission in hospitals or to buy medicines for their kids. Your role is to
guide them to get good care in time and that is affordable.
Village people have a practical sense of solving problems with simple
resources. Thus they should be involved in village health planning to assesshealth needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address thecommon problems.
Schools, fair price shops, water, electricity, seeds, fertilizers, credit, animal care,
bus/jeep, roads, employment, forest produce, common grazing grounds, post-office, haat—we need all these services in the village. Health care is just onemore. It is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village. As ASHA, youshall do your best to help your own people in their struggle for health and sharejoys of life. People have expectations from you. In following pages, you willlearn about your specific tasks to be undertaken by you as ASHA.
VViillllaaggee  HHeeaalltthh  PPllaann
You should participate in Village health planning and help nursedidi, anganwadi
behen, and Panchayat members. This will be the foundation of all health workin the village. Village health planning helps us to select important health issuesand make a work plan to solve them. Everybody's participation is necessary.NGO workers, school teachers, representatives of self help groups will also helpin micro planning. You should ensure that marginalized population groups suchas Scheduled castes, tribes, minorities and women are adequately involved inthe planning process. When people participate in planning, they also help inoffering solutions and carrying out the tasks.
Most villages will have health and sanitation committee. The committee
members take initiative for development of village health plans. Village healthplanning needs some facilitators They bring people together, activate them tothink and plan with people, map out problems and encourage solutions.Depending on the availability some NGOs workers can provide facilitation.Teachers can also help you. You should work proactively with anganwadi behenand nurse Didi to decide on the venue and timings for the planning meeting.
Village health plans provide a framework for health related actions. Many
actions lead to health. Village planning is a community approach to solveproblems. You will learn more about it in the subsequent exposures of ourlearning programme.8 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

Example: Development of a plan for tackling sanitation problem in village
Let village teachers, Nursedidi, Anganwadi behen, artisans, Panchayat members,
NGO workers meet and form a core group. You will be one of the members ofthis group.
This group should go around village observing village sanitation and other
problems. You may involve students in village rally so as to raise awareness ofsanitation issues inform about time and venue of planning meeting. Songs andstreet plays also invite attention of people.
Then gather in a central place open to all. Draw a village map on a big paper or
a wall. Ask people to draw their house in the map. Map waste water cesspoolsin village. Discuss about problems. The village planning may take 2-3 days also.
Ask people sources of wastewater flowing in the street or in cesspools. Mark
the house with things like tamarind seeds, small stones etc. Mark houses havingfever cases. The Nursedidi, and the Anganwadi behen and MPW will check thehouses. They will discuss about malaria with villagers and talk of solutions.Think of solutions to eliminate breeding sites for mosquitoes. You can handlemore problems in the same meeting. Think of handling problem of malnutritionamongst children in your village and how such exercises can be useful.

Health information and communication is more important than pills and
injections. Proper information and advice help people to avoid diseases andstay healthy.
Health information is a lasting asset. Currently villagers especially poor women,
men and adolescents do not have access to information on health issues. Youcan fill this gap and act as a local resource on health issues. Availability ofinformation will trigger changes in health promoting behaviours and adoptionof healthy practices.
/square6We should select issues close to people’s hearts and needs. Attend to moreimportant problems first.
/square6See what people already know and build on existing knowledge base.
/square6Understand the problems from their viewpoint also.
/square6Share health information with them and find possible actions.9 ASHA: MY EIGHT TASKS

During your work, you need support of other persons engaged in
health related activities.
In the village, we have Anganwadi, the Dai and some other healers. We will
learn more about them soon.
The Anganwadi Worker (AWW)
Anganwadi is for village children under six years. They get supplementaryfeeds in Anganwadi Centre (AWC). AW behen weighs children regularlyand keep growth cards.

Other Healers
The Village Vaid uses herbal medicines. He may have some knowledge of herbs
and some Ayurvedic remedies. Some cures may be good. Faith healers practicecures with help of mantras and mindtechniques. They are also called as“Bhopas”, “Ojhas” in some communities. People go to them for some types ofillnesses. The advise given by them may be of doubtful nature.
The Nursedidi (ANM)
The Nursedidi is very important for all our work. She works from the health subcenter. She visits 5-6 villages and hamlets in turns. Her work includes:immunization, care of mother and child, childbirth, contraceptive services,some medical aid etc.

Counseling needs knowledge of the subject. Knowledge grows with time and
more reading and discussing. Counseling also needs skills about talking withdifferent persons—men and women, young and old etc., understanding theirviewpoints. It calls for sensitivity and empathy.
Counseling also needs motivating skills. Different problems involve different
solutions. Therefore motivating becomes necessary. We often do it in thefamily. This is how we arrive at a decision after weighing pros and cons ofseveral alternatives.
You can also do effective counseling after some experience.
EEssccoorrttiinngg  ppaattiieennttss  ttoo  aa  hhoossppiittaall
Many people need to go to a town or city hospital for higher care. They feel lost
and helpless in such situations. Often, they face difficulties in such situations.Also somebody from the family has to stay back to look after children andcattle, getting money, farm work etc. They often need you to accompany them.
You can ensure that needy people get the right help. You also can help in
deciding to go at the PHC, Community Health Centre (CHC) or the districthospital. If the CHC is far away, people may choose to go to other suitableprivate or trust hospital. In some emergency situations (like bleeding during orimmediately after birth) time is precious. Situations that need escorting are:
/square6Childbirth and immediately after childbirth, difficulties during pregnancyand childbirth.
/square6Abortion and bleeding

PPeehhllaa  ssuucchh  NNiirrooggii  KKaayyaais one of the saying. It means healthy body is the most
important pleasure of life.
Good health leads to productive, happy, and a long life. Both
the body and mind need to be healthy. And our relation withthe society should also be healthy. People often think healthis linked to medicines, doctors and hospitals only. This is notalways true.
Hospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. But
first we need to take care of our body. You can preventdiseases, promote health and prolong life.
We say Aarogyam dhansampada. This means health is real wealth. Health
makes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. Ill health keeps us
away from work and livelihood. Ill health means spending on doctors andmedicines. In villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle topay for hospital expenses. The money people spend on tobacco and liquoralso causes ill health. Following health practices protect our wealth andincrease productivity.

In this lesson we will
learn about
What is health?
What make us healthy?What leads to ill health?How health and ill health

HHooww  ttoo  rreemmaaiinn  hheeaalltthhyy??
Some parental gifts make part of one’s health. Like body features, frame, height,
weight, looks, skin and color, some mental traits etc. Sometimes we even get
some health problems linked to parental gifts. We
can avoid marriage among blood relatives to
avoid some of these inborn defects.
Many social and economic factors
also cause ill health. Poverty is the
root cause of many sicknesses. Low
purchasing power limits access to
adequate amount of food and
balanced diet. Women suffer from
sicknesses during the process of giving
birth to a baby.
Also health care utilization is impacted adversely on account of poverty.
Ignorance also contributes to sickness. Certain traditional practice are
harmful. You should try to know about these traditional practices in
your village.
A lot of health depends upon factors like
/square6Clean drinking water, clean air
/square6Balanced diet,
/square6Healthy personal habits,
/square6Healthy home and surroundings
/square6Healthy working conditions.
/square6Supportive family, friends and society
/square6Staying away from vices like alcohol, tobacco, multiple partners etc.
Timely use of health services like immunization, birth spacing, mosquito bednets etc is also necessary for health. If we fall ill, seeking treatment early isvery important in several illnesses. Examples are TB, cancer, high bloodpressure, pneumonia, snake bite etc. Late action may harm. Every hourcounts in such situations.
To stay healthy, we need to adopt healthy practices, and use health services in time.16 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

We often say that one looks healthier than someone else. Healthiness shows up
in happiness. But we often use ‘measures’ for health.
When selecting young men/women for police or army, parameters such as
height, weight, chest circumference etc are used. We also use several tests(eyes, blood, urine etc) to test assess health of an individual.
We can talk of ill health in similar ways. We relate ill health to illnesses—cough,
fever, diarrhea, TB, polio, drunkenness etc. At the level of community we usesimilar words. For instance, we say there are more people having fever this yearthan the last year, or fewer people with diarrhea or no case of AIDS in thisvillage. Or more infants dying in this village as compared to other village.
Some examples of how we discuss health and ill health in the village:
/square6This year we have more/fewer fevers in the village.
/square6How many TB patients in the village?
/square6Mother and Child deaths in the village in last year.
/square6Number of underweight babies in the village.
/square6Number of teenage girls giving birth to babies.
/square6Number of smokers and alcoholics in village.
/square6Mental attributes-are people happy, number of suicides etc.
You can make our own checklist based on our situation and needs. A
comparison tells us if our village has better health than the last year or thenext village.

In India many people go to open fields for defecation. You need to help them
in getting sanitary latrines installed. These are convenient for young girls,women, aged, sick person and children who often find it difficult to go tofields. You will get more information about construction of sanitary latrinesfrom the block Panchayat office. After defecation, most use water-wash foranal clean up. This soils the hand with germs. It is necessary to wash the handsthoroughly after this, with soap or ash. Some people use paper or leaves ofsome trees for anal clean up.

Many diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid etc are caused due to germs present
on dirty hands. You should ensure that your hands are clean, especially beforeeating any food. Wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap andsee the difference in wash water. You will appreciate the difference. After goingto the toilet and before having meal, we must wash our hands thoroughly.
Wash the hands with a lot of water first. Apply soap or ashes and rub on the
hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. Again, pourwater. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin.
Cutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be
fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned.

Our teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in
the tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums.
We must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food
particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine whathappens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and notcleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we don’t clean our mouth aftermeals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash.
Discourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. That causes stains.
Smoking also makes teeth dirty.
Use of ash is good, but it cannot clean the gaps.

Stale food and germs can collect onyour tongue and cause bad breath. Brush at least twice every day, before andafter sleep. This would prevent plaque formation.
Brushing too vigorously or using a hard brush may cause damage to gums.Change the brush if the bristles look spread. A worn out toothbrush will not
clean our teeth.
Toothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. Therefore brushing is a cheap
way to keep the teeth and gums healthy.

People in the village often use datoun, a 8-10 inches long and small finger thick
twig of neem, babool or Karanj etc. This practice is good. After chewing thetwig a bit, the end becomes bristly. The bristles can clean gaps between teeth.The medicinal properties of datoun keep the gums healthy. Datoun should not20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

Our culture regards daily bath as a ritual. It is indeed necessary in hot weather
as sweating makes us dirty. (In very cold regions one may skip daily baths.) Usewater economically. Some people like hot water. Massage with warm sesameor mustard oil is good before bath. Temperature of bath water should be neithertoo hot not too cold. After retiring from daily work, we should wash feet, handsand face with water to remove dirt and sweat.
CClleeaann  ccllootthh
Clothes with comfortable fitting be used according to season. Cotton clothes of
light colour are more comfortable in summers and warm clothes in winters. Ourundergarments and other clothes must be clean to keep away skin infectionsand louse infestation. A daily change is healthy practice.

Combing the hair everyday is necessary for its health. A head-bath is necessary
especially if your hair stinks due to sweating. Mixture of Shikakai, Reetha and Amlasoaked in water is a simple, cheap and safe way for washing oily and sticky hair. Forlouse, we need fine combs. Avoid using somebody else’s comb as it may have louse.

Proper footwear is necessary to keep away germs and worms in the dust from
getting onto your feet. Many people walk or children play barefooted in thefields. Sometimes these fields are also used for defecation. The worms presentin the faeces may get entry in the body when we walk bare footed. You willlearn more about these worms in subsequent books. Dusty and hot weather alsocracks our soles. Some people buy shoes, only to use them during festivals orwhen going out to meet their friends and relatives. This is not good. The Indiancustom of keeping footwear outside the house is good.

delivers oxygen and nutrients to different parts
of body and removes toxins and wastes. Our

sources in the village. Good water is god. But
dirty water can be demon.
Many illnesses come from consumption of dirty

Use only safe sources - a clean hand pump or covered sanitary well or piped
water supply. Fetch the water at evening and keep it covered and still overnight.Stale water is safe at least for two days.
If necessary strain the water in a fold of cloth. It will remove bigger particles
and some insects. Use a clean dhoti or sari.
For any turbid water, use alum to settle dirt. For this just dip alum in the water
for 2-3 rounds and then keep away.
Do not dip hands in the water container. Remember your hands may be dirty.
Children are often in habit of taking water from vessel by dipping their handsespecially after play. Use a ladle (handle-cup) instead.
We can also make water safer by boiling
it for about 15-20 minutes after therolling starts.
Chlorine addition is just one way of
making water safe. Overnight storageof water makes it practically safe.Boiling is good, but also needs fuel.
If you have chlorine drops, add 2 drops in
one bucket. Use this water after keepinghalf hour. If you have no chlorine drops, we canmake a stock solution from bleaching powder.
Take one liter water in a jar. Add a teaspoonful of well-kept
bleaching powder to it. Usually bleaching powder is available withMPW or Nursedidi. Stir it well and keep it still for five minutes. Pour thesolution into a plastic bottle using a strainer. Keep off the un-dissolvedpowder. Cap the bottle and you can use it for 2 days. Take 5 ml (in a big23 WATER SAFETY AT HOME

Pools and streams of wastewater are common scene in a village. Nobody
likes it. This dirty wastewater is from our baths, kitchens and cattle-shades. Mosquitoes breed in such stagnated pools. They give us sleeplessnights and malaria fever. Many deaths occur due tomalaria, and many more fall sick and suffer. Malaria feverincreases risk of abortions. Some other illnesses alsospread due to mosquitoes. We can avoid all this at littlecost and effort.
Wastewater pools also stink. They make life difficult for those
staying nearby.
It is a hazard for small children. Children can fall in these
cesspools and hurt themselves.
We can put the wastewater to good use for a kitchen garden.
This will enrich our meals and avoid sleep less nights. If kitchen garden is notpossible we can dispose wastewater through a soak pit.

Kitchen garden is a way to use wastewater to produce vegetables for
ourselves. The plants use up the water and we get fresh vegetables at no
extra cost. What we need is only some place to do
this. The vegetables we can grow are:
fenugreek, spinach, dhaniya, carrots,
tomatoes, gourds, lentils etc. We can have
about 20 varieties of vegetables. We
should also grow commonly available
medicinal herbs such as Tulsi, Kumari,
Podina etc alongwith vegetables for use
of common ailments.
If we have more waste water, perennial
trees, fruits and plants like drumstick, mango,
guava, lime, papaya and banana Most people like
fruits and we certainly need them for vitamins and minerals.
MMaakkiinngg  aa  SSooaakk  ppiitt
Soak pit must be used to avoid pools of water, particularly in the streets and
common pathways.
We can construct a soak pit near our house and around public places. This will
absorb drumfuls of water without forming a pool. This will avoid breedingplaces for mosquitoes.
Dig a pit of 1.5 meter length, breadth and depth. At the bottom put loose stones
and brickbats. After filling 1/3 of the pit put smallerhalf size brickbats. Fill 1/3 of the pit thus. Fillthe top third of the pit even smallerbrickbats.
We need to avoid rain water from
entering the pit. For this raise itsborders by 10 centimeters above theground level. Fill it with dry grass orcoconut coir on top. Better put a usedearthen pot at top, with hole in bottom.26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

This helps in straining. Connect the wastewater into this pot by using a pipe.
Cover entire area with coir. The coir works like a filter. Clean or change the coirevery month.
You can learn and teach people by demonstrating a soak pit construction. You
may also get more information from Panchayat. Explain people about nuisanceof waste water. Motivate people to develop kitchen garden in their houses.Discuss this issue in the village planning meeting. People can help each otherin constructing soak pits.

Food items in the meals should have all the tastes. Sweet food are heavy to
digest and hence should be consumed first. Avoid overeating. Always try toheat, when one feels appetite. Do not skip meals for long intervals if there isno medical indication. While eating the simple rule is – donot overfill thestomach, one third of the stomach should remain empty for facilitatingproper movements and digestion of food. Do not eat too hot, too cold and toospicy food. Never eat hurriedly. Combination of dal and cereals (like khicri) ishealthy practice.

Food has five basic elements: fats (fats from oils and ghee), proteins (white of
egg, pulses-milk) carbohydrates (cereals, sugar, sweets), minerals like calciumor iron, and vitamins. Minerals and vitamins are necessary in minute quantities.You will learn about nutritional values of commonly consumed food.
Food grains like rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra etc make the bulk of
our daily food. They give us energy. Some people think that only rice and wheatare good. The reality is different. Bajra, ragi, jowar, maize are not inferior foods.These also rich in nutrients.29 OUR HEALTH DEPENDS ON FOOD WE EAT!

Pulses and beans provide body building
elements. Meat, eggs, fish and milk and milk
products are richer in proteins.
Oils and ghee provide lubrication
besides extra energy. Children need to
eat enough fats. Weight for weight,
they give double energy as compared
to cereals.
Green leafy vegetables and fruits help in blood
formation. Vegetables also give us the fiber
(roughage) necessary for normal bowel movements.
Body requires some minerals like calcium, iron, iodine and zinc. Some
nutrients called vitamins are necessary in small quantities. Both these are
present in vegetables, fruits, sprouts and salts.

weight at the age of one year. Adult maintains body weight. Weightreduces in old age.
Underweight is because of under-eating. Majority of village women and young

Like we build our house, nature has built our bodies. For a house we need
stones, bricks, mud and cement, wood, tins or roof, tiles, pipesand wires etc. From these we build foundation, pillars, walls,rooms, windows, doors, floors, water supply, lighting, kitchenchulha, drainage etc. All these parts have different purposes.Similarly in the body we have many parts or organs fordifferent functions. Together they make the human body.
Different organs doing different work are linked together
as organ systems. Various systems do various tasksnecessary for life. So we have systems for breathing, bloodcirculation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. And all the bodysystems work in cooperation. The body has control systems for this, viz brain,nerves and hormones.
Bones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement
possible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of differentshapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints makemovement possible. Hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. Andjoints are so different.Body Mapping and

You may have seen the guts of sheep or
chicken. Human gut is about 22 ft long-
more than a room length. Gut is part of
the digestive system and digests/absorbs
food. While passing through, food will
be mixed with secretions from different
glands. It also throws off the waste.
Whatever body cannot put to use in sent
in large intestine and later leaves body
through anal opening. Digestion gives us
energy to work and nutrients to build and
repair the body.
Respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside
our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let
out. Oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy.
We have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body. This goes in rounds thanks to
our heart pumping each second. Do you know how much blood the heart pumpsin a day? That will fill a water tanker of 10000 liters in 24 hrs. The heart keepsyour blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs andnutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body.Younger you are faster is your heart beat. The blood carries nutrients andoxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks andwagons in the body, through the vessels.
Urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat.Reproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction
and continuation of life on earth.
We know the world through our five windows. We call them sense organs. The
eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure,vibration and pain.
Thanks to the Nervous system, we respond to these signals. Human brain is
most complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or changealertness. This is necessary for our survival. The Nervous system controls severalbody functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.34 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

Some of our organs are seen from outside like eyes, ears, breasts, testes. Let us
see where the other organs are –
Bony skeleton and attached muscles give body its basic frame. Skin covers all
the body and protects it from outside environment. Soft organs are inside thechest and abdomen. Brain is inside the skull.
A butterfly like important gland (Thyroid) is present in front of the neck. Goitre
is actually a swelling of this. Iodized salt prevents it.
When we take a deep breath the chest expands. The lungs inside the chest and
fill like balloons. The wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs.It indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk.
Fear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times
in a minute. We can feel the beats pounding in the chest. Put an ear to yourfriend’s chest. Can you hear heart beats? Where is it? Heart is just left of themiddle of the chest. Pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of thebody. These carry blood from heart to all parts. Can you see the veins under yourskin? Blood is brought back to heart through veins.
Let us drink a glass of cold water. Do you feel it going down from throat to
stomach? Food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upperabdomen. Stomach stores and digests food for 1-2 hours. Then the food passesdown the gut.
Do you feel the rumbling in abdomen when you are hungry? A long coil of gut
is in the middle of abdomen. This does further digestion. The long coils lead toa wider short pipe called colon. The well known appendix sits on the colon onlower right corner. Appendix does not serve any special purpose in the body.
Colon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen walls– going up from lower right
side, and then becomes horizontal going left. Then it goes down to the bagstoring waste. Finally it reaches the anus.
Liver is high up on the right side. A swollen liver can be felt below the lower
right ribs. Similarly on the left side we have a small spleen. In some diseasessuch as Malaria, spleen becomes very big. We can feel it below the left side ribs.35 BODY MAPPING AND OVERVIEW OF ORGANS

Two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of
abdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes.
One feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time.
That is where the urinary bladder is. From bladder the urine is let out througha single tube opening on genitals.

Testes are hanging in a pouch to keep them cool. From the testes two thick
cords carry sperms to two small bags close to urethra. They make semencarrying sperms. The semen is thrown out through urethra at the end ofsexual intercourse.
In women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus
–the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in thelower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones. The womb grows inpregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the wombon the abdomen.
Two egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. The tubes have free finger
like ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovariesflank the uterus.
Outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women.In men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the
end of a long muscular penis.
In women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. Inner vulva is soft tags of
flesh. These are aptly called inner lips of vulva. The inner lips are connectedabove at clitoris. Clitoris is small external bud like organ. A fleshy cushion ofvulva–called outer lips–protect all these parts.
The vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. Hymen, a thin sheet
with holes covers the vaginal opening. This may be torn after puberty. Afterpuberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. Breasts also grow in women atthe age of maturity.
At maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.36 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

take to stooping posture. Boys often worry about the differences in the size ofgrowing penis. Differences in growing moustache or beard and change in pitchof voice can also bother adolescent boys.

Many men women treat women badly, and
even beat them. Women are also sexuallyassaulted. Such women suffer frominjuries and other health problems.
Women’s health problems are often
ignored or treated late. They have toget permission of the in-laws orhusband’s even for health check up. Theyoften have no money to pay for healthcare on their own. Our health services arealso not fully sensitive to women’s healthcare needs.
Infertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. But
usually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis-treated.
If a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. In reality it all depends
on the man’s sperm. We will learn later to see how the sex of the baby isdetermined. Many families go for abortion if it is a girl baby in the womb asthey want sons. You can check from your anganwadi behen as how many boysand girls are registered at Aanganwadi centre.
Women bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. They also bear burden of
preventing pregnancies. Most contraceptive methods are for women and veryfew for men.
Women’s reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually
transmitted infections. Vagina provides a larger surface,delicate skin, longer time to hold fluids, moistness tomake germs stay alive for longer. So they get moreinfections than men.
Even illnesses affect women differently. Malaria fever
can cause abortions, affect growth of baby in the womb.
On top of all, women are married young. They suffer its
damage in several ways-socially, economically, andto health.39 WOMEN AND HEALTH

Alcoholic husbands exploit women in several
ways. They treat their family member
harshly everyday to show off the

There are fewer amenities for toilets for
women. In the village, they have to go to
answer nature’s call either early morning
or evening.
Villages may have no air pollution, but that is not
true for women. They work in kitchen smoke for 4-5 hrs everyday. It gives
them coughs and headaches.
And do you know, still they are hardy enough to live longer than men. If

In this lesson we will learn about one way of communication —
Group meetings. You have to match the group, topic and methodof communication. Mismatch of these three will not produce anyimpact. For instance for bringing behavioral change aboutsanitary latrine, we need to talk to women (and men).
We can plan and do it as follows:
Get a group of 5-10 women/men (not more) in
somebody’s house. It is good to select a
venue which is accessible to all
especially women from scheduled
castes/ tribes are comfortable. It is
useful to select a house, which
already have a sanitary latrine.
You need to communicate to people
in advance about the venue and
timing of this meeting. You can also
talk with members of self help group in
the village.

In this lesson we will
learn about
How to organize a group
meeting

PAGE 48

We can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. Just
provide the beginning or let someone begin.
Gradually other members of group will also start
participating in the discussion and share
their problems.
If we have a model or flip chart about
sanitary latrine, we can share it now. If
someone in the village has got a
sanitary latrine to a smokeless one, that
can be a demonstration.
Explain the basics of the sanitary latrine,
and how one can make it. A good flip chart will
have all that explained in pictures.
Discuss ways of how Panchayat can help families in constructing sanitary
latrines and what assistance is available.
While conducting a group meeting:
/square6Set up some ground rules in the beginning. Let one person speak at a time.Talk with participants with full interest and eye contact. You should beconvinced of the topic yourself for full confidence.
/square6Let your audience participate in the discussions .Encourage them to askquestions. Some people will come out with good ideas. Never scold orridicule anyone. Let things proceed in democratic manner. Let peoplesuggest solutions.
/square6Do not open up topics which are ambiguous or difficult. The messageshould be clear and doable for the group.
/square6You may not complete the topic in the same meeting. One can follow it upin the next opportunity. But take things a step ahead.
/square6Communication is effective if we follow our own advice at our home.People learn better with live example. They learn even better by doing itthemselves. Mere talk, pictures, slogans, songs may not work. (These thingshave a complementary role)
/square6Do not underplay the complexity of the problem. Problems can be reallycomplex. We need to understand the factors and the interplay. For instance42 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

PAGE 49

some people say that there is no water to
use in sanitary latrine. Now you have tocome up with solutions.
Change may be slow. However in everycommunity there are some innovatorswho are open to new ideas. You needto encourage them . Sometimes newgeneration takes up changes fasterthan old people. Change is often slow.People cannot give up traditions easilysince they find it easy to work with. Newthings need adjustment.
At the end sum up the discussion and what was decided in this meeting.

Dai: In each village you will come to know
about Dai ma. There may be more than
one dai ma
in a village.
Dais conduct child birth, although it is not
possible for them to manage women
when there are difficulties during child
birth. You need to develop rapport with
dais in your village. Try to find out them
if they have undergone any training in
past. We will know more about Dai in
following chapter.
Anganwadi Behen: Do you know about the
anganwadi behen in your village. What are her
functions. We will know more about her work in the following chapter.
You will have to work very closely with anganwadi behen. One day in each
month is observed as “Health Day” at centre. You need to mobilize children,
pregnant women for health services offered by nurse Didi on health day.Know Health

Who are the health workers
in village?
What do we mean by sub
centres and PHCs?

PAGE 51

Nurse Didi: Where does our nursedidi work from? It is a health sub center. The
sub center actually works for 5-6 villages (3000-5000 population). We have a
nursedidi called ANM and a health worker brother called Male MultipurposeWorker (MPW). Together they do various tasks for the villages. We will need towork with them more closely.
TThhee  HHeeaalltthh  SSuubb  CCeenntteerr
Let us look at our sub center more closely. The
health sub center may be your nearest healthfacility. Our sub center has a nursedidi anda MPW. Their main tasks are:
/square6Immunization of children toprevent six dangerous illnesses.Routine checkup of pregnantwomen, conducting normaldeliveries and post natal care.
/square6Helping couples to adopt spacingand sterilization services.
/square6Treatment for TB, Leprosy and Malaria
/square6Treatment of minor ailments.
/square6Visiting Anganwadis and schools for health check up.
/square6Child care including treatment for diarrhea and coughs
/square6Advice on village sanitation, water safety etc.
The ANM and MPW have difficult tasks. The villages under their care spreadout on 8-10 km area. They have to often walk distances, and be on move. Theyvisit houses to conduct provide some services. For some services likeImmunization, they conduct clinics on a fixed day each month in a centralplace such as anganwadi centres in the village. They have also to make reportsof monthly health activities and attend meetings at PHCs.

A PHC is usually at some big village in your area. Your block may have 5-10
PHCs. Each PHC has 5-6 sub centres and serves 25000-30000 population. Eachvillage falls under one of them. Have you ever been to the PHC?
A PHC has 1-2 doctors, nurses, compounder and other staff. With its 4-6
subcenters the PHC’s main activity is for preventing diseases, promoting healthand treatment of illnesses. Here are the main activities:
National health programmes related to Women and child health, malaria,
filariasis, TB, Leprosy, Blindness, sexually transmitted infections and HIV-AIDS.Some specific activities are:
/square6Immunization against six diseases.
/square6Health services for pregnancy, childbirth and after.
/square6Health check up and treatment of school children.
/square6Control of disease outbreaks- like diarrhea.
/square6Treatment of diseases.
/square6Birth spacing and sterilization, early and safe abortions.

The PHC doctor has many tasks to do. Treatment of illnesses is just one. He also
has meetings to attend and he may also be required to conduct post-mortems.
PHC doctors treat illnesses in the Out Patient Department (OPD). Some patients
are admitted in the PHC. Sub center health workers refer patients to PHC. ThePHC may also refer some patients to the CHC or District hospital. Some patientsmay need to go to the district hospital.
Each PHC doctor also visits sub centres covered by that PHC. Doctor has to
supervise work of nursediddi, meet villagers and also provide services.

Inform people about the facilities available at these health centers. For
instance, talk of childbirth or TB treatment and free care.

You can help her in so many ways.
The babies younger than 3 years cannot
come on their own in the AW. Motherssometimes bring them to AW atmealtime. However, often they areeither left at home or taken along onwork. Many babies suffer undernutrition after breastfeeding stops.They remain undernourished. How canwe help in this problem?
Parents assume that the child gets a full meal in
the Anganwadi, and may give it less in the home. This makes thesupplement less helpful. you need to talk to child’s parents on this.
Some difficulties about regular food supply affect AW services. You can
raise these issues during meetings with Panchayat members.
Anganwadi-behen has some records to keep. She is often hard working and
gives lot of time for this work. She can be of great help to you in all yourworks. With her help, you can improve child health services and servicesfor mothers.

In this lesson we will
learn about
What is illness, its causes,
germ illnesses, immunity,healing? In this lesson wewill learn only aboutgermillnesses.

PAGE 60

Not all illnesses make a scar after
injury–common cold, flu, malaria, sore-
eyes are some examples. But some
illnesses cause a scar inside the body.
TB is one example. It leaves a scar in
the lungs after cure.
Some illnesses have a cause in the
mind–mental illnesses.
Healing is a natural process. Good nutrition
and immunity help healing. Healing leads to cure.
And most illnesses heal. But some can get worse as they have no cures.
Can you name some diseases with no cure.
GGeerrmmss,,  wwoorrmmss,,  iinnsseeccttss--iillllnneesssseess  aanndd  iimmmmuunniittyy
Most of the common illnesses are due to germs, small insects and worms. We
can often see worms in the excreta. The small insects like louse are visible. The
scabies insect is even smaller. Germs are too small to see with eyes. For this weneed a microscope. Have you seen a microscope.
Examples of germ illnesses are: Malaria, chickenpox TB, measles, leprosy, many
types of diarrheas and dysentery. The gravity and period of illness vary with thegerm-type and our resistance to that germ.
Immunity is the resistance of our body to fight germs. Immunity develops as
body gets experience of
fighting germs. Immunity helps us recover from a germ-illness. Immunity may
be natural like in leprosy. Remember only some people get leprosy illness, manyescape it.
Mother’s breast milk gives some immunity for the baby. The first few days’ thick
milk is a priceless shield for the baby. Sadly, many infants do not get it becausewrong beliefs and practices.54 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

PAGE 61

We can also create immunity against some germs. We give babies vaccines to
make them stronger against some illnesses. Complete immunization in timeprepare body to fight against germs of certain diseases.
For many germ illnesses, we use medicines. TB, malaria, and leprosy are some
illnesses we can cure with medicines.
But some illnesses like hydrophobia; AIDS, etc are without effective cure. These
small germs are called viruses. Recently AIDS has some good medicines thoughno permanent cure is possible.

Nature heals most illnesses. Our body has such healing
properties—like the tree healing itself. We can help the process
of healing with medicines. We need good nutrition for that.
We have many types of healing systems. The Angreji system
is well known. Ayurveda employs herbal and other
medicines. Sidhaa is a similar branch. Unani is also herbal
system. Homeopathy uses very small dose of medicine in
sugar based tablets. Naturopathy uses water, mud, diet etc
for cures. Yoga also heals some illnesses. In acupressure and
acupuncture, special points on the body are used to cure
health problems. In the village the traditional Baiduses herbal remedies.

Annexure at the end of this book tells
you about use of each drug; dose, howmany times to be given, side effects, andprecautions. Read carefully all this before usingthe drugs.
These medicines are safe, cheap and very effective. They will help us in many
illnesses. We will learn about some more medicines in the subsequent books.

Injections and saline are necessary only in some situations.
Injections and saline used in clinics are not so often necessary. Frequently
injection and saline are given for profit and not for cure. False beliefs aboutinjections and saline are rife. We become poorer by paying the hard earnedmoney for many needless injections and saline. We can save these expenseswith help of simple remedies and raising health awareness. But peoples’attitudes take time and efforts to change.
Patients are being charged anything like 50 Rs more for one bottle. It is just
water and salt and some sugar. If we prepare and drink at home it, the cost isjust fifty paise. Its effect by mouth is also equal to saline. Some patients insistson injections and bottles and doctors also are driven by profit motives. You caneducate people about utility/futility of injections and bottles.
TToonniiccss
Tonic bottles are also very popular. Many healers prescribe and patients ask for
tonics. Are tonics necessary, do they give us strength as promised?
The answer is NO. No medicine book prescribes tonics. Tonics are just some
water, sugar, vitamins and some minerals. The cost is often very high. In the57 USING REMEDIES

same cost one can take an egg daily or a glass of milk for a full month. This is
a much better buy for the money. Tonics also create a false sense of cure. Manyparents wants their doctors to prescribe tonics for their children.
You need to educate people on the futility and costs of tonics. It will save
peoples’ money being wasted. It will also help them in improving their diet.

Medicines are very useful and are life saving at times. Overdose can be harmful,
especially in children. Medicines can have side effects too. You should ask yourdoctors about the dosage schedule of drugs.

care. Keep it in a well-capped bottle. It will stay
for one year. Apply this to wounds 2-3 times a
day. This heals the wound well.
For childbirth injuries, neem water bath is a
healing treatment. Crush some leaves of neem
and put them in warm bath water. Let the mother sit
for fifteen minutes in this bathtub.
2. Tulsi (Oscimun Sanctum)
Tulsi is a small herb, but having great medicinal
properties. Tulsi leaves are mainly used for someailments. They are useful in cough and cold. Givethe tulsi juice with honey. The leaves are hot innature, that is they are used in kafadosha. Thedecoction of Tulsi leaves is also useful forcough. The leaves are chewable.
The seeds of tulsi are cold in nature. Hence the seeds
are used in heat (pitta) disorders like heart burn, bleedingfrom nose, Burning feet, bleeding piles, sore mouth etc. Give the seeds with milkor ghee. Soak 20-30 seed grains in water or milk. This is a dose for once. Takeit 2-3 times a day.
Take about a cupful of tulsi leaves. Soak them in water for five minutes. Then
crush them on a stone. Strain in cloth and collect about 20 ml juice (half a cup).Crush more leave if necessary to make 20 ml. This makes 3 doses for one dayfor an adult. This is good for cold and fever illnesses. Give it for 3 days. Forchildren the dose could be 10 leaves juice, 2-3 times a day.
3. Kumari (Aleo Vera)
Kumari (Aloe) is a garden plant. In wounds, we
can appear aloe in place of a medicated
dressing. Take a piece of aloe about the size
of the wound. Cut it into a slice. Clean the
wound with water. Apply the aloe slice on it

Kumari is used in several Ayurvedic preparations. It is useful for liver disorders
and women’s illnesses like pain in the periods. It is also used for dandruff andfor the growth of hair.
You can grow kumari in your garden and ask people to grow in the kitchen
garden. It is hardy plant and stays for years.
4. Adusa (Adhotoda Vacica)
Adusa is small shrub grown for fencing. It is good remedy forcoughs. Use fresh
juice or decoction of leaves. Fresh juice of leaves is used
with honey. It is useful for bleeding disorders eg. Bloodin cough, blood in stools, urine etc.
Take 50-60 gms of adusa leaves and wash them clean.
Slow boil the leaves in one liter of water for half an hour.About one fourth water should be left. This is adusa Kawatha for coughs.Cool and filter it. Give 20 ml once, 2-3 times a day for three days. One canadd sugar or honey as per requirement.
5. Kuda (Holerrhena antidysenterica)
This is a forest tree with typical fruits. The fruit is black in color when fullyripe. The fruit is like thin doubledrumstick but in twins. The bark or coverof the tree-stem is used for medicine. This is a good medicine for loose
motions and dysentery. You can simply groind a piece of
bark and mix with a spoon of honey and give as
medicine. Kadha (Kawatha) also is useful. For
this take a 10 gm (2 teaspoon full) of bark
powder, add one glass (200 ml) of water and
boil. Boil it till ¼ water remain. Cool
and bottle it. For an adult 20 ml kadha
(Kawatha) for 3 times a day is useful to
stop dysentry.61 HOME REMEDIES

For bleedingwounds press with Haldi powder to stop it.Haldi also has great wound healing properties.People use haldi with oil for cuts and abrasions.This is good practice. The practice is to apply it withmilk and chana dal flour (besan) at the time of bath, asUBTAN to improve complexion.
Triphala is a very useful combination of three fruits:
Aamla, Hirda, and Beheda. We can use the triphala
powder in constipation. It is useful to reduce
obesity and diabetes. Its external application is
very useful for healing wounds. Triphala powder
can applied on skin at the time of bath. Its
decoction is useful for gargling in illnesses such
as sore throat, Stomatitis, and bleeding gums.
Triphala powder is also used as tooth powder and
vision disorders.
Oil massage is good for pain in the joints. Medicines may still be necessary for
joint pains. Sesame oil or coconut oil are considered good for massage. Massageimprove blood circulation in the skin.
Mulethi is very a useful plant. It is available as
small dry sticks. The stem is used to improve
voice if it is hoarse. It is given with honey.Mulethi powder is useful in cough and hyperacidity . It improves the brain functionwhen given with cow's milk. It is also usedin pitta disorders-because Mulethi hascooling properties.

Early marriage and teenage pregnancy is damaging to a woman’s health in
several ways. It leads to abortions, premature births, risky childbirth, small baby,and subsequent effects on the family. It takes away the joy of living,prematurely. Girls tend to drop out from school due to early marriage. We canstop early child marriages by creating awareness in community. Talk about lawsagainst child marriage.
Repeated pregnancies cause anemia, cancer cervix and prolapse
of uterus. Repeated childbearing causes a woman lot of stress.
Her health deteriorates.
Abortions are best avoided, except when essential. We will
know about termination of pregnancies in other books.
Unsafe abortions through illegal providers (quack or doctor)
are riskier than childbirth. Abortions can also cause infection

Couples can plan it with help of safe days and othercontraceptive methods. Spacing between two children keeps mother andchildren healthy.
Contraception methods are available to prevent and space pregnancies.
Preventing unwanted births is a right of every woman and couple. We shouldtry and meet this unmet need.

We have temporary (reversible) and permanent contraceptive (sterilization)
methods. In the next chapter we will talk about condoms for men.
Use of condom by the husband is the easiest options for spacing between
two children. Condom is a rubber balloon available at PHC or SC Healthworkers, or at the common village shops. You will also have condoms in yourkits. It prevents entry of seeds present in semen. Condoms also preventsinfections in genital tract of women and men. Condom should be removedcarefully after each intercourse to avoid leakage. If not used properly thismethod may fail.
IuDis a device used for spacing. It is inserted in the uterus. Doctor or nurse
puts an IUD in uterus after proper examination. This method is most
reliable. Proper selection of a woman is necessary for IUD. There areother temporary contraceptives available for regulating interval betweentwo births.
Oral pills: woman has to take one tablet daily for 28 days. Injectable
contraceptives are also available with private practitioners. We will know about
these methods soon.65 PREVENTING UNWANTED REGNANCIES

Immediate breast feeding within half an hour after birth is vital for the baby. It
gives baby nutrition and immunity against illnesses. It shrinks the mother’swomb and reduce bleeding. Milk flow is better with frequent suckling.
Breast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. No other feeds including
water are necessary. Consult a Nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeedingproblem even after your help.
Mother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. On delivery
the breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. The baby should befed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ-attacks. This should not
be thrown away.
Breast milk provides for all the needs of the baby. It also
contains sufficient water for the baby’s needs. No need for
feeding water separately. More the baby suckles, the more
milk is produced.Breast FeedingBreast Feeding

Breastfed babies normally feed every
two hours. Well fed babies sleepquietly for 2-3 hours, and gain weightnormally.
Breastfeeding postpones mother’s
menstrual cycle. Hence many of them donot get pregnant soon. You will learn aboutcontraceptive effects of breast feeding in theprogramme.
Help for problems like cracked and sore nipples, painful breasts due to
milk hold up. If the nipples are sunken the baby can not suckle well.
Mothers need to be reassured about their breastfeeding abilities and that baby
gets adequate nutrition. Breastfeeding can prevent more than 10 lacs childdeaths each year. Breastfeeding should be continued whenever possible for atleast two years.

For sunken nipples pull them out gently

nipple-shield directly over the retracted

This helps the baby to breast feed. It also
helps in bringing out the nipple.
Clean the nipple shield thoroughly before
and after every feeding.

nurse didi in your village. They are also given at thesub centers and the PHC.
Vaccines need cold storage during transportation to
retain their power.

BCG is usually injected on the baby’s left
shoulder. A scar is formed six weeks after
injection. It shows that the child may have
become immune to Lung TB.
Give also five doses of vitamin A. Start
from nine months age, and give every six
months. This protects children from night
blindness. Vit A also boosts child’s
immunity against germs.
We all know that many parents deny their
children immunization. Immunization boosts body’s fighting power
against diseases caused by germs. You can help them by explaining
benefits of immunization. Accompany them during immunization
services in village.82 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA

Very effective cure for TB is available. One has to take the medicines in
front of ANM or MPW or any health provider. This is called directlyobserved treatment (DOT). The improvement occurs in a few weeks.However, the full treatment takes 6 to 8 months in most cases. Our rule isto make the patient complete the full treatment. You can also be aprovider for DOTs treatment to TB patients in your village. Try to get moreinformation above DOTs treatment from nursedidi or male worker. Duringtreatment the sputum is tested periodically for germs of TB. Rememberthat services are available free!

Most snakebites are non-poisonous. Snakebites are common in rainy seasons
and night hours.
Two-fang marks are typical of a poisonous snakebite. Look for fang marks. It is
easy to know the 4 common poisonous snakes. Cobra, krait, big viper and thesmall viper are the four main harmful snakes.
Effective and quick first aid can save most patients. No magic or
temple prayers can undo the poison bites. The 90% cases are
saved because the bite was non-poisonous. Panic can
also kill.
Drooping eyes or bleeding are first signs of poison.
Drooping eyelids or sleepiness point to cobra and krait bites.
Bleeding from bite, gums, urine, in vomit means viper bite.Snake BiteSnake Bite

Reassure the person and the family. Tell them it may be non-poisonous. Make
the person lie down and relax. Do not make patient walk. . In case of nonpoisonous snake bite, it s enough to clean and disinfect the wound.
Tie the entire limb with an elastic bandage. This slows blood flow from the limb.
Then tie a stick to the limb to lessen movement.
Shift to the nearest hospital. Keep looking for poison signs of drooping or
bleeding. Take along the snake if it is brought killed. This helps intreatment. Now specific anti snake venous infections are available. Youshould know about the hospitals where anti snake venom drugs areavailable in your area.
Many people kill snakes indiscriminately. This is not good. Snakes eats
rodents which causes loss of our food grains. And many of them arenon-poisonous.

/square6Do not waste valuable time in a temple or with a Tantrik. Remember even
some Tantriks have died due to snakebite.
/square6Do not tie a tourniquet (single band string as was practiced till sometimeago). This causes the bite to bleed and may also stop blood flow to the limb.More than 2 hours to tight tourniquet can cause blackening and then lossof the limb.

Introduction
In Book No. 1, you have read about the tasks to be performed by you for 
improving access and utilization of services for health, nutrition, drinking water and sanitation. You have also read about details of registration of pregnant women, Janani Suraksha Yojana, breast feeding, infant nutrition, immunization and diarrhoea. In this Book you would be learning in greater detail about the menstrual cycle and fertility. You would also be learning about the care to be given to a pregnant woman during pregnancy, delivery and during post-natal period. In case a woman/family does not desire to continue a pregnancy, we should help them access services for early and safe abortion as per provisions of MTP Ac t. You will learn about how to 
h
elp them access safe abortion services in this Book. You will also learn 
more details of newborn care, infant and young child nutrition, diarrhoea and also care and advice to be given in case of diarrhoea, fever and acute respiratory tract infection in infants and children.
You will learn about methods for preventing unwanted pregnancy, care 
for reproductive tract infections, prevention of HIV/AIDS and care to be given in case of malaria, TB or other such health problems as well as minor ailments in Books No. 3 and 4. 1

PAGE 109

Menstruation and 
Fertility
 Duration of bleeding :  three-five days 
 Bleeding recurs after  : 25-35 days
 Flow  : without clots
In a regular 28-day menstrual cycle the mid 10 days (10th-20th day) of 
the cycle are fertile period during which pregnancy can occur, the first day being the day when the bleeding starts. 2
Normal Menstrual Cyclelining 
breaking 
downIt is very important for women to know about how their body functions especially in relation to reproductive health because they are uniquely gifted with the capacity to give birth to a baby. You know that by the time a girl reaches the age of 10-13 years, a number of changes occur in her body preparing her to meet the complex child birth process. The normal menstrual cycle has the following characteristics: 
blood & tissue being 
lost through the cervix & vaginacervix 
(neck of 
uterus)uterus
vaginaovary developing 
egg (ovum)
fallopian 
tube
egg has not been fertilized lining of uterus not needed to grow a baby

PAGE 110

A woman can become pregnant from the age of 13-16 (when her periods 
begin), up to 45-55 years, (when they ultimately stops). When they stops it is called menopause. If the pattern of menstruation is different from that given above or there is bleeding again after menopause or the bleeding continues after 55 years of age a woman must consult a doctor. 
A girl or woman should consult a doctor if: 
 bleeding lasts for more than six days
 there is too much bleeding especially clots
 there is bleeding in between the cycle
 there is pain during menstruation
 there is infrequent bleeding
 there is bleeding during sexual activity
How reproduction occurs
All females produce “egg” and males produce “sperms” which unite inside 
the womb of the woman and produce a foetus. This grows into a baby. 
The sex of the baby is determined by sex 
chromosomes, through which we inherit our parents’ traits. A woman’s egg has X chromosome and a man’s sperm has either X or Y chromosome (which we may call girl sperm or boy sperm respectively). At the time of fertilization, the X male chromosome of female egg meets either a girl sperm (XX) resulting in a baby girl or a boy sperm (XY) resulting in baby boy. Neither the man nor the woman can do

10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
anything to make sure that either a boy or girl is born – this happens 
completely by chance inside the woman’s body depending on whether a boy-sperm (XY) or girl-sperm (XX) meet with the egg. Hence it is wrong to blame a woman for not giving birth to a baby boy, as is generally done.
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
As ASHA, you may come across some couples in your village who have no children, or the woman is unable to get pregnant after one or two abortions. If the woman is 20 years of age or above and has been living with her husband for two years, leading a normal marital life but has not become pregnant, advise the couple to consult a nurse or directly go for a check-up to a doctor. Both partners must go together for infertility treatment as either or both of them may be having some problem, which needs treatment. Please note that couples often live apart because one of them has migrated in search of a job. It may be difficult for such couples to have a baby. 
It is also possible that women are being blamed for having only girls. Some 
women may be deserted by their husbands and families for not producing a son. You should clearly communicate the role of men and women in deciding the sex of a baby.

PAGE 112

Care during 
Pregnancy3
Pregnancy is a natural event in the life of women of reproductive age 
group. However, during pregnancy and childbirth some problems may arise which can threaten the life of the mother, baby or both. It is possible to identify women with some problems quite early if they have routine ante-natal check-up. This will enable them to access specialist care. Care during pregnancy is important to monitor progress and growth of the baby, detect complications at the earliest and treat them accordingly. During the visit the woman and her family should be advised proper nutrition, rest, exercise. They can make plans about where to deliver. This will help both the woman and baby to have a happy and healthy outcome. Minor ailments of pregnancy (e.g. vomiting, heart burn, constipation, backache etc.) are looked after during ANC.
PregnancySchedule of pregnancy care 
 The first visit is recommended as soon as the woman 
feels that she is pregnant This is called registration of pregnancy, which ensures that all pregnant women receive care throughout pregnancy.
 In villages/districts where female foetuses are being 
eliminated before birth, it is further important that pregnancy is registered early.

PAGE 113

12 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
 The second visit should be made between the fourth and sixth 
month 
 The third visit should be planned in the eighth month 
 An additional visit in the ninth month would help provide better 
care. 
 If the health worker identifies health problems during these visits, a 
visit to a doctor will become necessary.
What is done during pregnancy check-up and care?
 During the first check-up the complete 
history of this pregnancy and previous 
pregnancies, if any, and whether the woman has had any medical/surgical problem in the past is taken. 
  The ANM will weigh the woman to see 
whether the woman is gaining adequate weight during pregnancy, and also check blood pressure (using a balloon-like instrument), and see whether it is normal or not.
  Breast examination to check whether 
breasts and the nipples are normal  will be carried.
  Abdominal examination will be done to know the growth/position of 
the baby.
  A simple blood test will be done to see if the woman is anaemic (lacks 
blood) and if so, the severity. If the woman has anaemia, prompt treatment will help prevent complications.
 Urine examination
 TT Injection
  During repeated visits, details of any problem appearing since last 
visit will be taken care of. BP, weight, and abdominal examination will be repeated.
  Iron tablets will be given to all pregnant women and also treatment for anaemia depending upon the blood test results.
  By carrying out a complete pregnancy check-up, the ANM would be able to detect problems and decide on referring the woman to a doctor.

PAGE 114

13
Pregnant women with any of the following conditions need to go 
to meet a doctor
 Repeated neo-natal deaths, stillbirths, premature births or repeated 
abortions.
 Vaginal bleeding during present pregnancy.
 High blood pressure or abnormal urine test. 
 If the woman’s previous delivery was through abdominal operation or 
she has had some other abdominal operation in the past.
 The woman has heart disease, anaemia, high blood pressure, jaundice 
etc.
 Very big size of abdomen. 
 Twins. 
 Baby is upside down or in abnormal position inside the uterus.
As ASHA, you should counsel and help in getting such women to 
hospital.
Home care during pregnancy
 The woman’s family and community have the key responsibility for 
making sure that the woman gets more food, takes rest and does not have to do heavy manual work during pregnancy
 The pregnant woman needs extra energy from food, for the sake of 
her own health, for the growing foetus and for effective breastfeeding later on.
 During pregnancy a nutritious diet which is rich in iron, calcium and 
protein is required. For this, a pregnant woman should eat more green, leafy vegetables like palak and sarson, dals, milk, jaggery, eggs, fish, meat, etc.  Taboos and restrictions on a pregnant woman’s diet, such as not allowing certain vegetables, fruits, milk and ghee, might in fact harm her and the baby. 
 Pregnant women are entitled to get food from the anganwadi 
centre. 
 A pregnant woman should not fast. This deprives her and the growing 
baby inside the uterus of essential food. 
 Pregnant women should not carry out heavy manual labour, like 
working on construction sites, famine relief, brick kilns, etc. Other members of the family and community should help to reduce her work burden.CARE DURING PREGNANCY

PAGE 115

14 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
 Pregnant, adolescent girls are especially likely to be under-nourished 
and are more likely to suffer problems during delivery. They need extra 
nutritious food and help for safe delivery at a health facility.
 Sometimes there are overweight pregnant women who need to avoid 
eating fat-rich food like oil, ghee, sugar, etc), but they should continue to eat vegetables, fruits, nuts and milk which are rich in iron, calcium, vitamins and minerals. They should also take regular exercise and consult a doctor.
Anaemia in pregnancy
Lack of blood in the body is known as anaemia. It is very common in our country. Anaemia in pregnancy leads to complications in pregnant women and can even result in the death of mother and baby. You should be aware that a pregnant woman with anaemia looks pale, feels tired, complains of breathlessness on carrying out routine work, and might have swelling of the face and body. Anaemia can be prevented and treated completely if the woman follows the advice of ANM/doctor. 
 Anaemia is treated with iron tablets, which have to be taken daily for 
many months during pregnancy or by giving injections. If the anaemia is severe, hospitalization and blood transfusion may be required.
 To prevent anaemia, all pregnant women need to take one iron tablet 
daily, starting after three months of pregnancy. In this way, she must take 100 tablets. 
 While giving iron tablets, the woman should be advised that some side 
effects might occur. However, they can be managed in the following ways:
 Nausea or occasional vomiting – this can be prevented/avoided by 
taking the tablet after meals.
 Constipation – this can be managed if the woman drinks more water 
and eats fruits.
 Black stools or mild diarrhoea.
Note
 Iron tablets should not be taken along with tea as that reduces its 
absorption. 
 Anaemia, pregnant women must have deliveries in hospital.
Malaria in pregnancy
 Malaria during pregnancy might be fatal for the woman and may cause 
abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight babies or premature labour.

15 CARE DURING PREGNANCY
ALL PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE EARLY REGISTRATION  
(1
2-16 Weeks)  
FO
LLOWED BY MINIMUM THREE ANTE-NATAL CHECK-UPS
AND 
HOSPITAL DELIVERY IN A HEALTH CENTRE OR HOSPITAL AS FAR AS 
POSSIBLE.
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: 
 You should identify all pregnant women in your village.
 You should help pregnant women in getting registered between 12-16 
weeks of pregnancy and in getting the next three ante-natal check-ups. 
 Ensure all requisite examinations/investigations are done for all pregnant 
women.
 You should know the date and time of availability of ANM in Anganwadi 
Centre (AWC) in your village and inform all pregnant women about the 
same.
 Advise pregnant women regarding importance of balanced diet and ensure 
that undernourished pregnant women receive supplementary food from AWC.
 You should track the drop-out pregnant women especially those who live in 
remote areas, are below poverty line, schedule caste/schedule tribe/migrants etc and help them in accessing health services. 
 Help eligible pregnant women to get benefits under Janani Suraksha 
Yojana
 You should also know 
1. The location of nearest FRU/hospital with obstetrician, anaesthetist, 
paediatrician, nursery, O.T. and blood bank. 
2. The mode of transport to reach facility should there be an emergency3. Approximate cost for Caesarean Section, blood transfusion and hospital 
stay, if it is a private hospital.
 In case, it is a second pregnancy, when a couple already has a daughter, 
ASHA needs to be alert to the possibility that the family may reject another daughter and counsel accordingly.

PAGE 117

16 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
As ASHA you should advise the pregnant woman and her family about 
the potential danger signs during pregnancy, delivery and after delivery, the post-partum period. If she has any of the following problems, she should be taken immediately to the nearest functional FRU directly:
 Any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.
 Heavy vaginal bleeding during and following delivery, especially if the 
woman is feeling weak and faint.
 Severe headache/blurring of vision.
 Convulsions or loss of consciousness. 
 Labour pains lasting more than 12 hours.
 Labour pains before eight months or 32-36 weeks of pregnancy.
 Premature rupture of the bag of waters or leakage of water from uterus 
membranes, leaking etc.
 Failure of the placenta to come out within 30 minutes after delivery.
 Baby stops kicking inside the womb

PAGE 118

Intra-Natal Care 
and Post-Natal Care4
Intra-natal care
Delivery occurs normally after nine months of pregnancy. If delivery is 
before time special care for baby may be needed. As far as possible a pregnant woman should have the delivery in a health centre or hospital even if pregnancy is normal. This is mainly because during delivery, labour complications may suddenly occur which can threaten the life of mother, baby or both. During delivery the time between starting of a problem to death of mother, baby or both is so short that it may not be possible to save the life of mother or baby if the pregnant woman is not already in a well-equipped health centre or hospital. 
 Ensure the availability of transport to the FRU/transport money 
available for the same, and how to access it in case of emergency and escort her.
 Find out the money/other provisions available under Janani Suraksha Yojana 
(JSY) for your area, who has the money and what is the procedure to get it and the reporting needed.

PAGE 119

18 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
 Counsel/advise the pregnant women and their families for institutional 
delivery.
 Identify the location of the hospitals, health centres, institutions near your 
village which provide delivery services round the clock, where delivery 
can take place and the cost for the same, if any and how to reach the hospital.
 Escort/accompany the pregnant woman to the hospital for institutional 
delivery.
 If there is no functioning health centre or hospital within reach, or the 
family prefers a home delivery, you should advise the pregnant woman and her family to have the delivery conducted at home by a skilled birth attendant (SBA) such as ANM, staff nurse or doctor. 
 In case a skilled birth attendant is not available, the delivery can be 
conducted by a trained TBA.
 Five cleans must be practiced during delivery: i.e. Clean hands, Clean 
surface, Clean new blade, Clean cord tie and Clean cord stump (do not apply anything on the stump).
 Place of delivery to be kept warm and free from draught.
 Help the mother in initiation of breast-feeding after delivery.

PAGE 120

19 INTRA-NATAL CARE AND POST-NATAL CARE
Post-natal care
Post-natal period is the period of six weeks immediately after delivery, 
which is important both for the mother and the newborn. In this period, the changes, which have taken place in the organs/system during pregnancy in the woman come back to normal, except breasts. Mother and the newborn are susceptible to some problems which you should be aware of, so that they can be guided for treatment/referral.
Care during post-natal period
 During post-natal period, a woman requires nutritious and balanced diet, 
which is rich in iron, calcium, vitamins and proteins. She should increase her intake of green leafy vegetables, pulses, jaggery, etc. and eat to her satisfaction. She should also take more milk during this period. 
 Under nourished women are given supplementary food from Anganwadi 
Centre by AWW. Ensure that they do come and receive it.
 It is important to give information about different contraceptive 
methods, which a couple can use during the post-partum period. A woman can have sex after six weeks, as by that time any perineal tear or other procedures carried out during child birth.
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
 Advise the woman at least one check-up within two weeks of delivery. 
 Advise the women to visit the ANM for minor complaints e.g. sore breasts, 
cracked nipples, foul smelling discharge, pain in legs etc. 
 Assist ANMs in conducting post-natal clinic and screening women and 
children with danger signals.
 Advise registration of birth.
 Counsel on exclusive breast-feeding for the newborn which: 
 helps in better involution of the uterus.
 can produce lactational amenorrhea and thus act as natural 
contraceptive.
 Counsel them on contraceptive needs (temporary/permanent) as required 
and help the women/family to get the same.
 Ask mother to report if there is:
 Excessive vaginal bleeding
 Loss of consciousness
 Fast or difficult breathing
 Fever
 Severe abdominal pain

PAGE 121

Newborn Care 
5
Every newborn needs certain essential elements of care immediately at 
birth and the first 28 days of life, irrespective of mode of delivery/weight of baby. It is important because for every 10 babies who die during the first year, five babies die in the first 28 days of their life. 
Skin to skin contact
Provide privacy to the mother. Request the mother to sit or recline comfortably. Undress the baby gently, except for cap, nappy and socks. Place the baby prone on mother’s chest in an upright and extended posture, between her breasts, in skin-to-skin contact; turn baby’s head to one side to keep airways clear. Cover the baby with mother’s blouse, ‘pallu’ or gown; wrap the baby-mother together with an added blanket or shawl. 
 When the skin-to-skin contact is not possible clothe the baby in one-
two layers (in summer), three-four layers (in winter) and cover the head & feet with cap and socks respectively. Let the baby and mother lie together on soft, thick bedding and cover them with additional quilt, blanket or shawl in winter.
 The baby should not be given bath immediately after birth.
 Advise the family that baby should be referred immediately to FRU if 
the baby has any of these signs:

PAGE 122

 poor sucking of breast
 becomes sicker
 develops fever 
 fast breathing
 difficulty in breathing
 blood in stool
 pallor of palms/soles

 develops yellow staining of the palm and soles
 feels cold or hot to touch
 bleeding from any site
 abdominal distension
 no meconium passed within 24 hours of birth
 no urine passed in 48 hours
Care to be taken during referral of newborn
 Mother should accompany the baby
 Fastest mode of transport should be used
 Baby should be kept warm, keep with mother whenever possible 
during referral.                                                      
 Breast-feed whenever possible
Weighing the baby
 You could find out if the weight of the newborn 
has been recorded. Baby should be kept with mother 
if found in green or yellow zone of the weighing scale.
 You should advise the women/families regarding cord 
care. No dressing/ medicine to be applied on cord.
 Advise regarding early initiation of breast-feeding 
immediately after delivery.
 Colostrum must be given as it prevents the baby from 
infections.
 Exclusive breast-feeding to newborn should be done for 
six months
 Baby should be correctly positioned during breast-feeding 
and should be fed on demand from both breasts each time. Feed the baby during the day as well as during night

No pre-lacteal feeds
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
 You should advise pregnant women and their families about institutional 
deliveries. In case institutional delivery is not possible, newborn care at home can be given as follows:
 advise the women to have delivery by skilled birth attendant.
 advise the mother to keep the baby warm and dry. No aggressive 
wiping to be done to clean vernix scaseosa as it can lead to loss of temperature.
 ensure that baby is kept in close contact with mother (skin to skin 
contact) as much as possible during day and night. If mother is not available, skin-to-skin contact may be provided by the father/any other adult of the family. 
 It is important to recognize that all newborn babies (both daughters and 
sons) need care.
 You should help parents to get birth registered with appropriate agency.

Unsafe Abortions & 
Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) 
6
You know that sometimes unwanted pregnancies occur. In such cases, the 
family or woman may want to abort the pregnancy. For this termination, pregnant women often go to untrained persons, dais etc. The methods employed by them for termination are not safe and the facilities are unhygienic. Hence, there is a great risk to the life of these women. You can educate such women with unwanted pregnancies about the dangers of these illegal, unsafe abortions. Such women should be able to confirm whether they are pregnant and if so, they can seek safe and legal abortion at a government health centre or government approved private hospital. 
Abortions have been legalized since 1971 under certain conditions, as 
given in under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (“MTP” Act). Such abortions can be carried out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy. 
Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks 
(2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to go a hospital. Abortions done early in pregnancy are also safer than those carried out later. Hence, the woman should not wait till her pregnancy has advanced.

24 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
 
As per PNDT Act, 1. Detection of sex of foetus during pregnancy is illegal. 2. Termination of pregnancy after identifying the sex of the foetus as 
female is also illegal. 
There are two methods of terminating the pregnancy:
Surgical abortion
This is carried out by evacuating the embryo either using a hand held syringe or electric suction machine 
Medical abortion
This is carried out by using pills
In both cases, it has to be done by a qualified doctor in any approved 
centre. Women undergoing MTP can get more details from PHC. There are advantages/disadvantages of both methods. In both cases, there has to be post-abortal care for the women undergoing MTP. 
Post-abortal care
 Follow up after abortion is a must especially after the tablets are 
given for medical abortion. 
 If the woman has any of the following symptoms, she should be 
immediately referred to the nearest functional FRU/District hospital.
 Severe bleeding or foul smelling discharge from uterus
 Severe pain in abdomen
 Fever
 Swelling in the abdomen or severe vomiting 
Counselling of the women will help them to seek safe abortions which will help in decreasing deaths among pregnant women. After an induced abortion, a woman can become pregnant again within six weeks. Hence, it is advisable for the woman (and her partner) to be counselled for appropriate contraception and help them to get the suitable contraceptive if they wish to adopt.It is important to remember:
 Termination of pregnancy below 
20 weeks is legal under provision of MTP Act.

25 UNSAFE ABORTIONS & MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY (MTP) 
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
 You should educate families and the community about the dangers of 
unsafe abortion 
  You should know 
1. which are the centres/institutions approved by government for performing 
MTP near your village
2. the days when MTP is done 
3. the expense if any.
 You can escort these women to the approved centres, if needed. 
 Advise the women that although abortions can be done up to 20 weeks of 
pregnancy, yet it is safer for the women to get it done before 12 weeks. 
 Educate them about the need to use effective contraception after undergoing 
an abortion, so as to minimize the need for further abortions.

Immunization
7
Immunization is one of the most well-known and cost effective methods 
of preventing diseases. Though most of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) are controlled by now, immunization has to be sustained, not only to prevent VPDs, but also a) to eliminate Tetanus, b) reduce the incidence of Measles and c) eradicate Poliomyelitis. 
The six vaccine preventable diseases are
DPT Immunization Tetanus
 Poliomyelitis
 Diphtheria
 Pertussis (whooping cough)
 Measles
 Childhood tuberculosis
The vaccines must be given at the right age, right dose, right interval and the full course must be completed to ensure the best possible protection to the child against these diseases. The schedule that tells us when and how many doses of each vaccine are to be given is called immunization schedule.

AWC.
 You should advise the mother to bring the immunization card every time 
she comes with the child for immunization.
 You should advise the mothers on use of Auto Disable (AD) syringes for 
immunizations, which come in pre-sterilized packs with a fixed needle. This helps in prevention of infection.
 You should help the mother in correct positioning of the child during 
immunization.
 Counsel the mothers that minor ailments, such as fever, cough, cold etc. 
are not a contra-indication for immunization. 
 You should guide the mothers regarding minor side effects after 
immunization
 Mild fever
 Baby has Mild rash after measles immunization
 Pain, tenderness and swelling at the site of injection
 All these can be managed by giving ¼th tablet of Paracetamol.
 Baby should be referred to PHC/FRU if after immunization

Diarrhoea
8
Diarrhoea is defined as passage of liquid or watery stools. These watery 
stools are usually passed more than three times in a day. Passage of even one large watery motion among children can be labelled as diarrhoea. Normally there are three types of diarrhoea:
 Acute watery diarrhoea starts suddenly and may continue for a number 
of days but not more than 14 days. Most of these are self-limiting and will last for three to seven days.
 Dysentery is diarrhoea with visible blood in stools.
 Persistent diarrhoea begins acutely but is of unusually long duration 
i.e. lasting more than 14 days.
Diarrhoeal diseases are a major cause of death and disease among children under five years. Majority of the deaths in diarrhoea are due to dehydration (loss of water and minerals). 
Four golden rules to observe if a child has diarrhoea
 If the child is breastfed, continue breast-feeding more frequently.
 If the child has started consuming other foods, continue feeding small 
quantities of these items.

PAGE 131

30 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
  After the child recovers and 
normal appetite reappears, 
the child may be given more food than normal to regain lost weight.
 Give extra fluids
 Give ORS (Oral Rehydration 
Solution)
 Advise the mothers to give Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). You must 
have adequate stock of ORS, being the depot-holder, especially in the monsoon season and during any outbreak of diarrhoea.
 Guide the mothers for preparing ORS. Take one litre of clean drinking 
water in a clean container after washing your hands with soap and water. Add one packet of ORS in it and stir it thoroughly so that the powder is mixed. Cover the vessel. One teaspoon of ORS should be given every one-two minutes to infants as per the table below: 
Advise the mothers to give Home Available Fluids (HAF) e.g. plain 
clean water, lassi, shikanji

Acute Respiratory 
Infection
9
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is an 
important cause of mortality and morbidity in children. Most children up to the age of five years are susceptible to ARI. If not treated in time some of them develop pneumonia, which can result in death. The child has some or all of the following symptoms:
 Cough
 Running nose
 Fever 
 Difficulty in breathing. 
Serious morbidity and death are preventable if it is identified early and treated/referred in time. 
Care during coughs & colds 
 Keep the child warm.
 Give plenty of fluids and continue breast-feeding.
 Give home remedies – ginger, honey, lemon, kadha, etc.
Respiratory Rate

PAGE 134

 Increase feeds after the child recovers.
 Enough rest is to be taken by the child.
 Giving immunization to children on time for vaccine preventable 
diseases also helps.
 Timely administration of Vitamin A. 
 Good nutrition and avoiding exposure to cold, dust and smoke will 
help in preventing pneumonia.
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
 Advise about feeding the child: the feeding should be continued during 
illness and the frequency of feeding increased after illness
 Clear the nose if it interferes with feeding (use saline and a moistened 
wick to help soften the mucus).
 Increase fluids; give the child extra fluids to drink.
 Soothe the throat and relieve cough with a home remedy such as lemon 
with honey and ginger, tulsi, warm water etc.
 Control fever using Paracetamol.
 Keep the baby warm.
 You should accompany the parents in taking the child to the nearest health 
facility if the child has any of the following danger signals:
 Fast breathing.
 Difficulty in breathing.
 Unable to drink.
 Lethargy (susti).ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION

Infant and Young 
Child Nutrition: Breastfeeding and Complementary Feeding
10
Nutrition is required for a child to grow, develop, and remain active 
and to reach adulthood without illness. Nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins are required in large amounts (macro nutrients), while some nutrients e.g. Vitamins, Iron, Calcium, Iodine etc. are required in minimum amounts (micro nutrients). Growth of the child can be assessed by plotting height & weight for the age in Road to Health Chart. If the child is not growing properly, it means the child is malnourished i.e. under nourished. 
Nutrition in children is divided according to age as is given below:
0-6 months exclusive breastfeeding 
  Infants up to six months are to be exclusively 
breast-fed. Feed at least eight times a day.
  Mothers should be encouraged to breast-feed on demand.
  Bottle-feeding should be discouraged and anxious mothers should be reassured. 
  Breast milk is the ideal food for young infants as it contains all nutrients.

PAGE 136

35
Infant and Young 
Child Nutrition: Breastfeeding and Complementary Feeding Chances of malnutrition in breast-fed infants are less.
 It prevents infection, as it is clean and free from bacteria. 
 Colostrum acts as the first immunization for infants.
 Breastfeeding enhances brain development 
 Breastfeeding increases mother and child bonding and helps in better 
development of the child.
6-12 months complementary feeding 
 Start home based complementary foods after six months 
four-five times a day.
 Continue breastfeeding as often as the child wants.
 If the child is not breastfed, it may be given undiluted 
milk by a cup and complementary food five times a day. Wash hands before feeding.
 Food should be mashed and it should be freshly prepared. 
12 months-two years
  Continue breastfeeding for two years or beyond. Give 
home based food four-five times a day 
Two years onwards
  Children should be given hence-cooked food five-six 
times a day as they eat in small quantities.
  Children should be weighed every three months to assess 
their growth in all age groups.
Malnutrition in children 
 A child with severe malnutrition is at risk of dying from 
various infectious diseases.
 All children less than two years of age should be assessed 
and the parents should be counselled.
 Additionally, children who appear weak or appear smaller 
for age need counselling to improve their nutrition.

36 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: 
 Support women to breast feed exclusively up to six months
 Educate families about complementary feeding, demonstrate preparing 
complementary foods
 Counsel the mothers to take the children for weighing at AWC at least 
once in every three months and look for under nourished children
 Counsel mothers not to ignore nutritional needs of girl child
 You should advise mothers regarding the availability of supplementary food 
from AWC and ensure that all eligible children get their entitlement from 
the AWW
 Track the undernourished children and ensure that they get the supplementary 
food regularly. The weight gain in these children should be checked at regular intervals.
Feeding during illness
Food intake of infants and young children decreases during illness, however the energy requirement increases. Hence, it is important to know how and when the ill child should be fed.
As ASHA you should:
 Advise the mothers that feeding should be continued even during 
illness.
 Food should be given in small amounts but more frequently.
 Simple home-cooked food should be given, which is easily digestible.
 Advise mothers to continue breast-feeding more frequently for a few days 
after an episode of illness.
 Advise the mothers not to dilute the dal or other foods for the baby. Take 
out food for the child and then add spices in the food for rest of the family. Add a spoonful of butter/ghee/oil in the baby’s food.

Micro nutrients (Vitamin A, Iron, Iodine)
Vitamin ‘A’ Deficiency 
Vitamin A is important for normal vision though in very small amounts. It 
is not possible for even that amount to be synthesized in the body. Vitamin A deficiency is most common between six months and three years. It can even cause even blindness. Night blindness is an earliest symptom. 
Iron deficiency anaemia
In children it is very common because of inadequate diet and recurrent infections and worm infestations. Give one small iron tablet daily for 100 days in a year to children under five years.Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
As ASHA, you should advise the mothers regarding:
 Six monthly doses of Vitamin A to be given to children between six months 
to three years.
 Increase intake of carrots, green leafy vegetables, yellow fruits, eggs, milk, 
fish etc. in food.
 You should assist ANM/AWW in tracking dropouts and give Vitamin A to 
children suffering from measles.  
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
 Advise regarding proper nutrition with iron and protein rich diet (jaggery, 
milk, eggs, pulses, green leafy vegetables, guavas, apples, etc.).
 Advise regarding prevention of diarrhoea and importance of de-worming.
 Inform that iron can cause dark discoloration of stools/increased or 
decreased frequency of stools.INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD NUTRITION: BREASTFEEDING AND COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING

Iodine deficiency
Iodine is a very important trace element. It is required for the normal growth 
and development of human beings. Its deficiency during pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion/still birth and cretinism/mental retardation in children.
You should advise the pregnant women to take iodized salt in food, which 
is enough to prevent the iodine deficiency.

PAGE 140

Fever
11
Fever is a common symptom of many diseases, which may be simple or 
serious. Some mild fevers subside without any treatment/treatment at home e.g. fever with no cough/running nose/ear discharge/with no rash/without diarrhoea/without any obvious infection etc. However, in many children it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness. For fever in children a blood smear examination should be done. 
Temperature and fever
Our body is warm both in summer and winter. When it is very hot outside, our body perspires. It releases water and cools like an earthen pot. When it is very cold outside our body shivers to generate heat. In all seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all its functions. The normal body temperature is just above 36
0C or 980F.
After an attack by germs, our body works very fast. It generates more heat and hence fever. But excess fever may be harmful and lead to several complications.

PAGE 141

40 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Measuring fever in adults
It is wise to take a sick person’s temperature even if 
she/he does not mention about having fever. Touch your own forehead and the person’s forehead with both sides of your hand. If the person’s forehead is warmer than yours, she/he may have fever. This is a simple way to find out if someone has fever or not. 
Thermometer is used for measuring temperature
    Take a simple oral thermometer and shake it well. 
See that its mercury mark is below normal (36°C or 98.4°F). Do not hold or touch the bulb of the thermometer. Hold the thermometer by the bigger end with no mercury because mercury line will go up and you might get a wrong reading.
  Put the thermometer’s bulb end under the tongue in the patient’s mouth or armpit for two minutes.
 The oral temperature is a bit higher than the armpit. 
 Take it out to see closely while turning it slowly.
 Record the temperature of a sick person. Is it more than 
36°C/98.4°F?
 Temperature of 37°C–39°C is mild fever.
 Between 39°C and 40°C is moderate fever. 
 Above 40°C it is high fever (refer any person with high fever after 
sponging and tablet Paracetamol). 
 Clean it with water after each use.
 For your information, thermometers have mercury inside which is toxic 
and hence adequate care should be taken when used for children.
Treating Fever
General treatment
 Mild fever generally needs no treatment unless we are thinking of 
some infections like malaria, TB, pneumonia etc.
 For moderate fever Paracetamol tablet is the best treatment. One 
tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. For more details see table

PAGE 142

41
on drugs in Book 1. Give tablet Paracetamol for two days. For high 
fever, tepid water sponging is good first aid, with Paracetamol tablets. If fever doesn’t come down with in two days, refer to the nearest health facility. Sponge the whole body with tepid water. Do not use cold water as it causes shivers. Do not give a blanket. Keep windows open
 Give enough water and fluids to drink.
 Light meals like khichadi, daal-rice, curd, dalia are soft and easily 
digested.
 Fever is the symptom of a disease. It is not a disease in itself. 
Paracetamol tablet or syrup is general remedy for fever. It only brings down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not kill the causative germs. For common colds and coughs, Paracetamol or herbal remedies are good enough and no other treatment is necessary. 
Some home remedies for fever
Home remedies soothe the effects of fever. Give her:
Gulvel kadha
Take a thumb thick piece of Gulvel. Add two-teaspoonful powder of dry ginger. Add 10-12 glasses of water. Boil on slow fire. When three glass full decoction remains, cool it. Give half a glass of freshly made decoction.
China grass tea
Tea prepared with China grass is a refreshing decoction for someone suffering from simple fever. 
Specific treatment for illness
For illnesses due to various germs we need to give specific medicines. Malaria, pneumonia, TB, etc need specific medicines other than Paracetamol. However viral illnesses have no specific remedies. Virus is a very small germ causing many fever-illnesses. Common cold, flu, dengue, jaundice etc are viral illnesses. 
Remember several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g., 
malaria, pneumonia, pus (anywhere) typhoid, TB, kala azar, filariasis, brain fever, HIV/AIDS etc. We will learn about them. As a thumb rule, do not wait for more than two days for cure.FEVER

Introduction
Book no. 1 helped you to familiarize yourself with your partners in your 
work in the village. In Book no. 2 you have learnt in general about your 
roles, simple measures to promote health and prevent diseases among 
women and children in your village. Yo u have learnt in somewhat greater 
detail about maternal and child health care including newborn care and 
nutrition. In this book you will learn in detail about how to prevent 
unwanted pregnancy, the various methods that are available, the merits of each method, the side effects that need to be watched for and advice 
that needs to be given. You would also be learning about what advice to 
give to women and men who have complaints suggestive of reproductive 
tract infections or sexually transmitted infections. This book will also 
build on your information on the causes, transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS. 
You know very well that there are many adolescents and young boys and 
girls in your village. In general, they may appear to be healthy, but they 
need advice and counselling for developing healthy habits. They may also 
need health care for some of the common problems. Also in some parts of our country, marriage takes place at an early age, so that pregnancy 
and child-bearing happens early in their life. Hence adolescent girls need 
to get proper care in pregnancy and childbirth. Adolescents need to be 1

told about the ill effects of early marriage and pregnancy. Over a period 
of time you will succeed in making sure that no girl below the age of 
18 gets married. Adolescents also need knoweldge and skills to promote 
their health and prevent diseases.
This book will help you in counselling the couples and individuals about 
family planning and how and when to get the services.

Preventing 
Unwanted Pregnancies 
What is family planning?
Many couples want to either limit the number of children in the family or 
wish to wait for some time before having children. Similarly newly married 
couples may like to delay having children for two to three years. 
There are several ways by which couples can plan their family’s size 
Benefits of family planning
Using any family planning method for preventing pregnancies can lead to 
following benefits for the health of mother and children in the family.
Mother
 Women with four or more children have greater risk of death during 
childbirth.
 Similarly older women have more problems during childbirth.
 If adolescent girls get married early i.e. before 18 years they start having 
children too soon. These girls are more likely to have complications or 
can die during childbirth. Also children born to these mothers have 
low birth weight and more likely to die in the first year.2

PAGE 154

10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Children
 If a woman has children too close i.e. less than 36 months interval, 
her own health and her children’s health suffer.
 Family with fewer children will be able to take better care of them, 
including their educational attainments, growth and development. 
Other benefits
 Some contraceptives i.e. condoms (both male and female condom) help 
in protecting against infections of genital tract including HIV/AIDS as 
well as preventing unwanted pregnancies.
 Some methods are good to regulate irregular bleeding from uterus.
 Use of family planning methods will allow women to exercise their 
right over their own bodies. If they do not wish to have more children then they can use contraceptives with discretion. 
Different family planning methods
Pregnancies are caused by the union of egg produced by the woman and 
the sperm by the man. The egg (which later grows into a baby after union 
with the sperm) is produced inside the womb of the woman. When a sexual 
union between man and woman takes place, sperms released to the vagina of woman swim toward the egg in the womb. Union of egg and one of the 
sperms results in pregnancy. The walls of the womb provide nourishment 
to the egg. The egg unites with the sperm and grows into a baby. 
There are five main types of family planning methods: 
Barrier methods
If the sperm does not reach the egg, pregnancy can be avoided. For 
e
xample, when a man uses a condom, the sperm remains inside the 
condom only. Therefore, the sperms are not able to reach the egg inside the womb. Thus pregnancy is prevented. 
ManSperm
EggWomanSperm enters the egg 
and unites with itFetus, which grows into 
a babyHormonal methods
This prevents the woman’s 
o
vary from releasing an egg, 
make it harder for the sperm to reach the egg, and keep the lining of the womb from 
supporting a pregnancy. For 
example Mala N tablets.

PAGE 155

11 PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES 
IUDs
These are devices inserted inside the womb. They prevent the egg and 
s
perms from fusing and also prevent implantation.
Natural methods
These help a woman to know when she is fertile, so that she can avoid 
h
aving sex at that time.
Permanent methods
These are operations, which prevent a man or a woman to have any more children in future.
Barrier methods
You will be provided with condoms for distribution to women who need them. Women are shy to buy them from the market. Many do not know 
how to use them and where to keep them.
Condoms (Nirodh)
 Prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections 
including HIV/AIDS
 A new condom is to be used each time during sex
 Correct and consistent use of condoms is essential to prevent unwanted 
pregnancies
How to use condom?
You will be shown how condoms could be used

What you have to do: 
 Advise families to use condom as a family planning method. Also explain 
that condoms prevent sexually transmitted infections.
 Make condoms available to all those who wish to use them.
 If the situation is suitable, you can show the couple how condom is used. 
Use a flip chart and a condom piece. Sometimes you will have to show it 
to the woman and ask her to share it with her husband. 
 Some myths and doubts about condoms need to be answered. The 
misconceptions are: 
 Condoms reduce pleasure of sex. 
 A condom user is an “easy” person.
 If not properly used, condoms can burst during use. In that case, advise 
to use emergency contraceptive pills. 
 The female condom is now available in cities, so that even women can use 
a condom. That is helpful when men are unwilling to put on condoms and it empowers women in risky sex situations. Dispose off the condom properly.
 Keep condoms in cool, dry place and away from sunlight.
 Keep a stock of condoms and show how to use them, and make 
condoms available.
Hormonal methods 
Oral contraceptive pills
Oral contraceptives come in cycle packs of 
28 pills. Only the first 21 of them contain 
hormones. The other seven pills contain iron 
supplements. One pill has to be taken each day. The iron supplement pills are taken 
after completing 21 hormone pills. Since 
most women are anaemic, the iron tablets 
are also helpful. These pills do not interrupt 
the sexual activity. Above all, unlike condom, OCP is a woman-controlled contraceptive 
method. There are several brands available

in the market. Our ANM and PHCs have supply of 
MALA-N. You could keep a supply of these pills. 
How to use OC 
Start the pill from any of first seven days of start of menstrual bleeding and continue until the pack 
finishes. Start a new pack again. Taken regularly, 
the pill is almost 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. These pills do not cause abortion.
If a woman forgets a day’s dose she should take 
both the missed and regular tablets together. But one must not miss it 
for more than two days. If missed for two days, advise her to take pills as soon as she remembers. She can continue taking the pill each day 
until the pack is finished and also use a condom for sex until seven 
hormonal pills are taken in a row.
You should always mention about the common side effects of oral 
contraceptives such as nausea, mild headache, tenderness of breasts, spotting between periods and sometimes-irregular periods. Explain that 
these side effects are not signs of any serious disease. These usually 
become less or stop in three months. 
You should help women in getting examined by ANM/Medical Officer, 
before starting oral pills. You should give monthly supplies to women who 
have started oral pills after consultation with ANM/Medical Officer.
Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP)
Emergency contraceptive pills are pills to be taken within 72 hours of 
unprotected sex. These pills are taken only in some emergency situations. 
These pills are especially useful for those women who have been subjected 
to unprotected sex, slippage or bursting of condoms during sex or sexual violence.
These pills are to be taken as soon as possible after 
unprotected sexual exposure preferably within 72 hours. 
These pills will also not work if the woman is already pregnant. She should take two tablets within an interval 
of 12 hours. 
PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES 
Take the first tablet as soon as possible 
within 72 hours of unprotected sex.
Take the second tablet 12 hours after you take the first tablet.

Next monthly bleeding will take place within 14 days of scheduled day 
of monthly bleeding. These pills are now available at health centres and 
also at pharmacy shops. No prescription is needed to buy them. They are 
available as EC pills in the programme. Several commercial and social marketing brands are also available. 
ECPs, taken as per instructions, provide protection against unwanted 
pregnancy. Discourage repeated use of ECP and advise for choosing a 
contraceptive method. ECPs do not protect against infections like STI and HIV/AIDS. 
Copper-T 
This is a small T-shaped intra-uterine device (IUD). It is made of pliable plastic with fine copper wire wound around its stem. Two plastic threads 
hang by its stem. After insertion into the womb, Copper-T stays in place 
and is effective for a maximum of ten years. Some Copper-T devices available in the market are effective for shorter duration also.
How does the Copper-T work? 
Copper-T works mainly by preventing sperms and egg from meeting. IUD makes it hard for sperm to move through 
the woman’s reproductive tract and reduces ability of 
the sperm to fertilize the egg. Possibly it also prevents implantation. What you should do:
 You are a depot holder for OCPs (Mala N) 
 You should explain all methods to the women and help them in making 
choices
 Start Mala N tablets after consulting with ANM/doctor that the woman is 
eligible for OCPs
 Tell her about side effects and when/where to approach a service 
provider
 Also provide information about ECPs and where these pills are available

PAGE 159

15
Copper-T can be used 
  Within seven days of last menstrual period
  After six weeks of child birth – This is the best time
 Only trained nurses and doctors should insert Copper-T 
 Copper-T should be inserted only at health centres or hospitals
 Women can get Copper-T removed any time on demand 
Copper-T is generally safe to use. However it is very critical that proper 
hygiene is maintained. Advise women to have check-up once after one month, then after three months and then once a year. 
Copper-T cannot be inserted at home because stringent cleanliness is 
n 
eeded during  Copper-T insertion. The woman can go home immediately 
a
fter putting Copper-T.
Women should learn how to check the presence of Copper-T. Sometimes 
its gets expelled out of the womb. It is easy to learn technique of feeling 
the nylon threads in vagina. Copper-T cannot escape the womb and go 
up. It can be easily removed by a nurse with a gentle pull. Some women 
have pain and bleeding after inserting Copper-T. It stops after few cycles. 
If the condition does not improve then Copper-T can be removed. There are no after-effects if Copper-T is inserted after six weeks of delivery.
Removal
Copper-T should be removed after 10 years or earlier if woman wishes to have a child, or when she develops heavy bleeding, lower abdominal pain, 
or severe backache. You should help women in getting Copper-T removed 
at an appropriate facility. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES

Natural methods 
There are also natural ways of preventing pregnancies. However, the 
woman has to learn many things that happen to her body during the 
menstrual cycle to adopt this method. Awareness of fertility means that a 
woman learns how to tell when the fertile period of her menstrual cycle starts and ends. Generally menstrual cycle of a woman lasts for 28 days. A 
woman is likely to be pregnant is she has sex during the fertile days (days 
8-19 of the cycle). The natural method of fertility control includes:
1. Avoid having sex
2. Withdrawal3. Safe period method
4. Cervical mucus methodYour responsibilities:
 Counsel women about FP methods including Copper-T
 Explain to them about the duration of protection and who can do insertion
 Accompany the woman to the nearest health centre for insertion 
 Advise women on proper hygiene and cleanliness
 Educate women on natural family planning methods 
 Talk about benefits of family planning to couples and individuals, boys 
and girls at different occasions. These issues can also be discussed in the meetings of self-help groups, adolescent groups. Include information about 
prevention of RTIs/HIV/AIDS also. Dispel any rumours or mis-conceptions about contraceptives in villages
 Find out the facilities where FP services are available such as NSV and 
female sterilization
 Accompany desirous men and women to a facility where sterilization 
services are provided. In some states there are monetary incentives for 
those motivating or accompanying sterilization or Copper-T acceptor
 Help nurse didi to contact women wanting to have a Copper-T insertion
 Promote male participation in family planning

PAGE 161

Safe period
Women with menstrual cycle between 26 and 
32 days can prevent pregnancy by avoiding 
unprotected sexual intercourse on days 8 to 19, 
taking the day of starting of menstrual cycle as day one. You should know more about standard 
days method from your ANM.
Cervical mucus method
The opening of the womb of the woman has a 
sticky fluid called cervical mucus. Typically the mucus is thin and sticky 
for two days before and after ovulation, which allows 
for easy passage of the sperm. This is the fertile period. In other days the mucus is thick, dry and breaks on 
stretching. These days are infertile.
These natural methods need a lot of self-control and 
have a very high failure rate. Therefore it is advisable to adopt other contraceptive methods that have 
low failure rate in case the woman does not desire 
pregnancy.
However, fertility awareness of a woman is desirable in case of couples 
with the problem of infertility to increase their chances of conception in many cases.
Your responsibilities:
 Talk about fertility awareness in the meetings of women’s groups. 
 With ovulation awareness a woman can choose to conceive or avoid 
conception in that cycle. However, it is essential to caution the couple on 
the high failure rate of this method.
 If a woman has not conceived so far, fertility awareness can help in timing 
the sexual intercourse and increase their chance of conception.
 For contraception, the couple needs avoiding sexual intercourse in fertile 
period.PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES

Lactational Amenorrhea Method
Breastfeeding under certain conditions can prevent 
the ovaries from releasing eggs. This method does 
not cost anything, but it is most effective for 
only the first six months after childbirth.
How to use breastfeeding for preventing 
pregnancy?
 If baby is less than six months old.
  If the woman has not had monthly bleeding after giving birth.
 If the woman is exclusively breast feeding 
the baby, (not even water) and feeding the baby whenever she/he is 
hungry, with not more than six hours between feedings, day and night. 
The baby does not sleep throughout the night without feeding.
Use another method of family planning as soon as any of the following things happen:
 Baby is more than six months old, or
 Monthly bleeding starts, or
 Baby starts taking other kinds of milk or other foods, or starts sleeping 
for more than six hours during the night
Your responsibilities:
 Communicate messages on the Lactational Amenorrhea Method during 
meetings 
 Explain to women about three conditions necessary for practicing Lactational 
Amenorrhea Method
 Assist the women for contraceptive method if she is not conforming to 
three conditions.

Permanent methods 
Vasectomy (male sterilization) 
This is a very small operation for permanently preventing childbirth. 
Vasectomy requires less time and not much trouble for men. No hospital 
stay is necessary. 
There are two methods for vasectomy
 Conventional vasectomy
 No scalpel vasectomy
Conventional vasectomy
The procedure takes a few minutes and the person can go home in an 
hour. An experienced doctor uses a scalpel to make a small slit in the 
scrotum, and finds the vas on each side. The vas is tied and cut to stop 
the sperms from reaching the semen sac. One stitch is required.
No scalpel vasectomy
The no-scalpel  method uses only a needle puncture to complete the 
p
rocess. No stitch is required. So no need to come back for stitch removal. 
This method is becoming popular. Now doctors are being trained in this new technique. There are less side effects of NSV as compared to conventional vasectomy. This is a safe and easy method and requires only 
10-15 minutes.
Men commonly think that vasectomy causes weakness — in work and 
sexual life. This is not true and there is no evidence about it so far. The testicles are not even touched in vasectomy. It is the testicles that secrete 
hormones and regulate sexual functions. Vasectomy does not affect this 
any way. There is a need to popularize vasectomy.
Why sometimes pregnancy occurs after vasectomy?
After vasectomy three months are needed to make the semen sperm-free. A condom has to be used during this period This point is often ignored by 
men and conception can take place. Condom use for three months after 
vasectomy can prevent chances of pregnancy. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES

Tubectomy (female sterilization) 
Tying and cutting the tubes that carry eggs (egg-tubes) is tubectomy. There 
are several ways of doing this procedure. In many states this operation 
is done using laparoscope (doorbeen). It blocks the meeting of ovum and 
sperms. This is a popular sterilization method in India. 
Two methods of tubectomy
Mini-laparotomy is the conventional method
This involves opening the abdomen through a small incision and operating by hand. Local anaesthesia is given by injection. 
The mini-lap method needs hospitalization for two days. It is useful for 
post-childbirth tubectomy, when the womb is still high in the abdomen 
and easy to reach.
Laparoscopy
This involves inserting a laparoscope into the abdomen and applying tight 
plastic rings on the tubes. Laparoscopy can only be performed when the 
womb returns to its normal size and position (at least six weeks after 
childbirth). 
Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually 
successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail.
Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be 
internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later 
if a tube happens to reopen. 
In cases of major complications attributable to sterilization, failure and 
unlikely event of death, you should help in accessing compensation 
available as per FP insurance scheme. You will get more information from your ANM.
Reversing sterilization (recanalization) 
For all practical purposes, sterilization operations are permanent procedures. But, in unusual circumstances like death of all children, recanalization to 
join the cut ends of tubes together can be adopted by the couple. But in 
both men and women, only one in four such procedures succeed. These facilities are available in big hospitals only.

Reproductive Tract 
Infections (RTIs) including Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)3
What are RTIs/STIs and how are they spread?
Many women suffer sexual infection, including abnormal discharges 
through the vagina, ulcers and sores in the genital region and pelvic 
infections. Men also generally have sexual infections.
Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections of the reproductive 
organs that are caused by various germs. Though RTIs can occur both in 
men and women, they are more common in women, because their body 
structure and functions make it easier for germs to enter.
RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted 
Infections (STIs). Reproductive organs can also get infected because of 
trauma during delivery, unhygienic practices during delivery and abortions, as well as overgrowth of germs normally found in the vagina. Poor general 
health, poor genital hygiene and early start of sexual activity are all 
factors that can make women prone to these infections. 
Many women suffer from reproductive health problems. Women are more 
vulnerable to these infections due to biological factors. Unequal power 
relations in matters of sex i.e. sexual violence, non-use of condoms by 
men also expose women to risk.

PAGE 166

22 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Why are these diseases not addressed?
Women are usually too shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as 
abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers. They have been taught to 
silently suffer problems related to sex. There is also a fear that if a woman 
is found to have RTIs, especially STDs, she will be labelled a ‘loose woman’. There is a reluctance to seek medical treatment because of inadequate sex 
education and less access to medical care. The ‘decision-makers’ at home, 
like the mother-in-law, would allow a woman to be taken to a health 
worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems or infertility, but 
not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal discharge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs.
RTIs have been badly neglected because they do not kill the person directly. 
They usually remain inside a woman’s body, giving her chronic abdominal 
and back pain or making her infertile. Many women keep on suffering 
and remain silent. 
Symptoms of RTIs 
In woman
 Abnormal vaginal discharge, which has bad smell and more quantity 
than usual
 Ulcers or sores over the external genitals
 Lower abdominal pain because of pelvic infection 
In man 
 Discharge from the penis
 Ulcers
The presence of RTIs/STIs could also be indicated in men and women by the presence of:
 Pain or bleeding during intercourse
 Painful swelling in the groin
 Burning pain on passing urine
 Itching around the genitals
Unless treated early, RTIs/STIs can lead to several complications, ranging from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility, to increased risk of HIV infections, ectopic pregnancy, cancer of the cervix and death. There 
can be pregnancy-related complications like premature deliveries, low

birth weight babies, stillbirths, abortions or birth defects. Newborns can 
also get eye infection from the mother’s birth canal, eventually leading 
to blindness and pneumonia. 
Abnormal vaginal discharge
Usually discharge can be normal if it is for short time and without other 
symptoms like itching or pain. Most women have 
normal discharge during inter-menstrual period, and 
pregnancy. It is normal to have a small amount of discharge or wetness that comes from the vagina. A 
change in the amount, colour and smell may mean 
an infection. Many infections of reproductive tract 
in women show as foul smelling or bloody-yellow, 
greenish or curdy discharge.
Causes of abnormal vaginal discharge
 Lack of genital hygiene, especially during 
menstruation can facilitate infections.
 Use of unclean instruments during delivery, abortions by unauthorized 
providers.
 Sex without condoms especially when partner is suffering from some 
infections.
It is important to remember that these infections are easily preventable and curable.
Preventing infections
 Advise women and families to have deliveries in hospitals only.
 Deliveries should be conducted by skilled persons only. 
 Abortions at registered hospitals only.
 Maintenance of genital hygiene during menstruation.
 Avoiding unsafe sex by use of condoms - women can’t always insist 
on condom use by partner. They need to learn negotiation skills for 
condom use. Availability of female condoms may also save women in 
such situations.
 Women should be encouraged to seek treatment from qualified providers. 
You can help women get services by going with them to PHC/hospital 
in city. Women generally feel shy and awkward to talk about it. 
 Complete treatment as advised by a qualified doctor is a must. 
The partner should also receive treatment in cases of STIs. Women

especially find it difficult to convince their husbands to get treatment 
as well and use condoms. You should counsel the family (including 
her husband) and seek the help of ANM/MO wherever required.
Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) in men 
The urethral discharge 
The complaint of urethral discharge is very common in men. Germs are 
the only cause of any pus from urethra. The most common germ causes 
yellow/white pus bead in the morning before first urine is passed. It is 
not always painful. Untreated, it causes bad kinks in the urethra and chronic infection. Men with such a complaint should consult a qualified 
doctor immediately. 
Prevention
 For prevention, the best policy is to avoid multiple sex partners, or 
risky sex behaviour.
 Early and complete treatment cures the infection and stops the spread 
to the next partner. 
 Sex is best avoided during treatment.
 Educate people on this illness and remove undue fears about them. 
This may save them hundreds and thousands of rupees.
 It is important to examine and treat the spouse or partner, as he/she 
will be infected also.
The spouse/partner may already have had this infection and illness in form 
of vaginal discharge and burning during urination. The infection may get 
inside the womb and cause pain and fever. It may become chronic if not 
treated early and properly. Therefore, always ask for any complaints, which 
the woman partner may have.
Your responsibilities: 
 Raise awareness about the causation, transmission and prevention of RTIs 
and STIs.
 Emphasize the importance of early treatment and partner management.
 Distribute condoms and emphasize on promotion of condom and safer sex 
behaviour.

HIV  / AIDS
4
HIV is an infection
A very minute organism causes HIV. A person having HIV germs in the 
blood is considered as HIV positive. One cannot tell if a person is having 
HIV infection, as this cannot be identified without a blood test. HIV can 
be transmitted through following routes: 
 Through unprotected sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal) with a person 
having infection. 
 Through blood transfusion when blood is taken from HIV positive 
individual.
 Through contaminated needles used previously in an HIV positive 
person.
 From HIV positive pregnant woman to child during delivery or 
afterwards.
HIV is not transmitted by
 Touching and kissing a person
 Playing, swimming together
 Using common bathrooms and toilets
 Mosquito bites
 Sharing other utility items

PAGE 170

26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Risky sexual behaviour
The main cause of HIV/AIDS spread is risky sexual behaviour. Sex with 
many partners without use of condom is risky sexual behaviour. It is not 
only due to having sex with many but also because many people stay away 
from homes and families for long periods of time, e.g. truck drivers. 
Women are more affected by HIV/AIDS in India as this is directly related to 
her economic and social status and gender inequalities. The existing social 
and gender norms have great impact on sexual activity and risk behaviour 
of men and women, which affect women more than men. Women also find it difficult to motivate their partners to use condoms or approach 
services for treatment of infections. 
In our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place 
through the sexual route. There are no “high risk groups” but there are 
some people who have high-risk behaviour. HIV/AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour.
The window period
After exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12 weeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period 
to get an HIV test done. 
AIDS is the disease
AIDS may occur many years after getting HIV positive, but the person is 
infected during this period. AIDS is a serious disease without permanent 
cure, though we have some medicines to reduce its severity. Suggestive 
symptoms of AIDS:
 Continuous weight loss.
 Persisting diarrhoea.
 Repeated fever or illness lasting more than one month.
 The minor features include chronic cough, itching, rash on body and 
genitals, oral thrush (fungal infection), bubos, and illnesses coming 
too often.
There is stigma associated with AIDS and often women suffering from AIDS have been abandoned by their families. We can help in removing stigma 
about AIDS. We can also help the patients to get in touch with support 
network for HIV positive people.

PAGE 171

27
You can help in preventing HIV/AIDS
Prevention of HIV/AIDS is the only effective way of escape through this 
deadly disease. Following points are important: 
 Creating awareness in community about risk and causation and advising 
men and women to avoid sex with many persons.
 Consistent and correct use of condoms to prevent infection.
 Counsel for HIV testing.
Women are caregivers for the family. When they are HIV positive, they may not get the required family support and care. Counselling for the family is very important. Emphasize use of condom and partner management, 
early detection and treatment of STIs. In some hospitals there are special 
services for pregnant women. This involves counselling, blood tests and 
provision of drugs to HIV positive mothers. This will reduce the risk of 
infection to the baby. Awareness among adolescent boys and girls about healthy family life including sex education is important.
Blood testing facilities are available at most district hospitals. Here blood 
test for HIV/AIDS is done along with counselling services.
Role & responsibilities of ASHA: 
 Raise awareness about, causation, transmission and prevention of

Adolescence : The 
Period of Growing Up5
Adolescence is a period of rapid physical and emotional development. This 
period starts around 10 years of age and extending till 19 years. 
 This is the period of rapid growth and development. 
 They experience changes in their bodies and minds during this time. 
 It is important that you give due attention to the health of adolescents, 
as the health and productivity of the nation depends on them.
As part of growing up, adolescents will go through puberty. Puberty is the time in life when the body undergoes changes from that of a child to an 
adult. You already know about the chemicals in the body called hormones 
cause these changes. Because there are so many changes happening during 
puberty, adolescents find it difficult to adjust to these changes and often 
they need support.
Not only does the body change, but the emotions of adolescents change too. How they think and feel about themselves, family and friends may seem 
different. As adolescents go through puberty, they 
like to take important decisions for themselves, take on more responsibilities and become more 
independent.

PAGE 173

Adolescence : The 
Period of Growing UpChanges in girls Changes in boys
Breasts:  In most girls, puberty starts 
w
ith breast growth. When breasts start 
to develop, one may notice small, tender 
lumps under one or both nipples that will get bigger over the next few years. When 
breasts first begin to develop, it is not 
unusual for one breast to be larger than 
the other. However, as they develop, they 
will be alike in size and shape. 
Hair:  Soft hair will start to grow in the 
p 
ubic area (the area between legs). This 
hair will eventually become thick and 
very curly. Hair grows under the arms and on the legs. 
Body shape:  Hips get wider and waist 
w 
ill get smaller. Body will also begin to 
build up fat in the stomach, buttocks, 
and legs. This is normal and gives body the curves of a woman.
Body size:  Arms, legs, hands, and feet 
m 
ay grow faster than the rest of the 
body. 
Skin:  Skin may get more oily. This is 
b
ecause glands are growing too. Almost 
all teenagers get acne at one time or 
another. 
Menstruation:  During this period 
m
enstrual cycle, or “period” begin. Most 
girls get their periods between 9 and 16 
years of age. Body size:  Arms, legs, hands and feet may 
g
row faster than the rest of the body. 
Body shape:  Adolescents will get taller 
a
nd shoulders will get broader. They will 
gain a lot of weight. During this time, many boys experience swelling under their nipples. This may cause them to 
worry that they are growing breasts. 
During puberty, muscles will also get 
bigger.
Voice:  Voice will get deeper. This may 
s
tart with voice cracking. 
Hair:  Hair will appear under arms, on 
l
egs and face, and above penis. Chest 
hair may appear during puberty or later, 
although not all men have chest hair. 
Skin:  Skin may get more oily and may 
s
weat more. 
Penis:  Penis and testes will get larger. 
B
oys get erections due to an increase in 
sex hormones. Erections occur when the penis gets stiff and hard - sometimes for no reason. This is normal. Body will 
also begin to produce sperm during 
puberty. This means that during an 
erection, adolescents may also experience 
ejaculation. This occurs when semen (made up of sperm and other fluids) is 
released through the penis. This could 
happen during sleep. This is called a nocturnal emission or “wet dream.” ADOLESCENCE : THE PERIOD OF GROWING UP

Your responsibilities: 
 Young people may have several questions about their body, sex and sexuality, 
and how to remain healthy. Sexuality refers to expression of sexual feelings. 
There is attraction towards opposite sex. They need information, and 
services. 
 You should inform and help the adolescents in getting services through the 
nearest government hospital, i.e., for health care and also during pregnancy, 
institutional delivery, access to contraceptives and services for RTIs/STIs 
and menstrual problems. 
 Males also need information and advice. 
 You may like to visit schools and talk to the young on these issues. 
 Alternatively, you can plan the visit of nurse didi to come to school and 
talk to the adolescents.
 If there are any adolescent groups in the village, you should meet them 
periodically. You may provide information on health issues and seek their 
cooperation and support in our health work. You may also be required to 
go with them to the sub-centre or PHC for health services. 
 Adolescents need support in the community. You can talk to Panchayat 
members, teachers, parents, local leaders and SHG members to provide 
information on the subject.
 You need to find out if Anganwadi Centres run a programme for adolescent 
girls: called Kishori Shakti Yojana. Adolescent girls receive more food under this scheme.
 Talk with adolescents in the meetings of Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan 
(NYKS), Yuvati Mandals and other youth groups on promoting health and preventing diseases.

Helping Adolescent 
Girls to Take Care of Themselves during Menstruation6
Staying clean
Generally girls living in small towns and cities use sanitary pads for 
protection during menstrual period, if they can afford them. These are 
readymade soft cotton pads worn inside the underwear to catch the blood 
as it leaves the vagina. These pads should not be reused. Some girls prefer to make their own pads out of folded cloth or wads of cotton. These pads 
must always be clean and dry when worn. They should be changed several 
times a day and disposed of by burning outdoors in a large empty tin. If 
cloth is used, they should be washed well with soap and water and dried in 
the sun. Sun light is the cheapest disinfectant available in nature. 
In villages there are certain restrictions imposed 
on adolescents during menstruation. Those 
restrictions (Don’ts), which are harmful should 
be discouraged, such as not taking bath during menstruation or not doing any physical work.
It is advisable to wash outer genitals well with 
water every day to remove any blood that is left.

Changes in bleeding
Sometimes, the ovary does not release an egg. When this happens, the 
body makes less hormone, which can cause changes in how often and how 
much a woman bleeds. Girls whose monthly bleeding has just begun – or 
women who have recently stopped breastfeeding – may bleed only every few months, or have very little or too much bleeding. Their cycles usually 
become more regular with time. Women using hormonal family planning, 
sometimes have bleeding in the middle of the month.
Older women who have not yet gone through menopause may have heavier 
bleeding or bleed more often than when they were younger. As they get 
closer to menopause, they may stop having monthly bleeding for a few 
months and then have it again.
Pain with monthly bleeding
During monthly bleeding the womb squeezes in order to push out the lining. The squeezing can cause pain in the lower belly or lower back, 
sometimes called cramps. The pain may begin before bleeding starts or 
just after it starts.
Tips for taking care
 Do exercise, walk and run 
 Rub your lower belly. This helps the tight muscles to relax.
 Fill a plastic bottle or some other container with hot water and place 
it on your lower belly or lower back. Or, use a thick cloth you have 
soaked in hot water.
 Drink tea with ginger. Women in your community may know of other 
remedies that work for this kind of pain.
 Take a mild medicine for pain with doctor’s advice.
Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS)
Some women and girls feel uncomfortable one or two weeks 
before their monthly bleeding begins. They may have one or 
more of a group of signs that are known as pre-menstrual 
syndrome (PMS). Women who have PMS may notice:
 Sore breasts
 A full feeling in the lower belly
 Constipation (when you cannot pass stool)
 Feeling extra tired

PAGE 177

33
 Sore muscles, especially in the lower back  or belly
 A change in the wetness of the vagina
 Oiliness or spots (pimples) on the face
 Feelings that are especially strong or hard to control
 Craving for certain foods and increased hunger and thirst.
Many women have at least one of these signs each month and some 
women may have all of them. A woman may have different signs from one month to the next. For many women, the days before the start of 
their bleeding is a time of unrest. But some women say they feel more 
creative and able to get things done. These symptoms disappear within a 
few days after the start of the menstrual period.
Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:
Advise to
 Eat less salt. Salt makes the body to keep extra water inside, which gives 
the full feeling in the womb.
 Try to avoid caffeine (found in coffee, tea and some soft drinks like 
cola)
 Try eating whole grains, dalia, soyabean, peanuts, fresh fish, meat, milk 
or other foods that are high in protein. When body uses these foods, it also gets rid of any extra water, so that belly feels less full and light.HELPING ADOLESCENT GIRLS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES DURING MENSTRUATION

Introduction1
You have by now learnt about how to help families in your village to 
access available services for: 
 care in pregnancy, delivery and post-natal period
 caring for the newborn, infant and child
 prevention of unwanted pregnancy
 early and safe abortion
 prevention and management of RTIs/STIs
 information and counselling for adolescents 
In the village there would be many other health problems like TB, malaria, dengue, blindness etc. You may come across patients who may have minor or major ailments and injuries, which need medical attention. Book number 
4 provides you necessary information in helping people access services 
available in the various National Health Programmes. In the past, programmes 
have suffered due to lack of community participation. It is envisaged that 
information available in this book will facilitate in organizing community action to achieve various National Health Programme objectives. 
India has a rich tradition of indigenous system of medicines e.g., Ayurveda 
and local health practices. Many people prefer to access and utilize 
services available from such providers. You will also learn about some of

PAGE 187

the remedies available in Ayurveda, Unani and Homoeopathy systems of 
medicine in this book. This will help you to guide people who desire to 
undergo treatment as per preference for the particular therapy.

Tuberculosis2
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It occurs 
commonly in lungs but can occur in different parts of our body i.e. 
intestines, kidneys, bones etc. There may be about 15 to 25 confirmed cases 
of TB in your village. Please ensure that 
all of them are identified and registered 
for treatment.
Lung TB spreads by air. When a patient of 
TB coughs or sneezes, the bacteria enters the body of other persons who breathe 
that air. However, TB can spread to other 
parts of the body too. In women, TB of reproductive organs can cause infertility. 
You can suspect a person of having tuberculosis if he/she has any of the following signs/symptoms:
 Persistent cough for more than three weeks especially with sputum
 Low grade fever especially during evening
 Weight loss/fatigueSpread by coughing

PAGE 189

10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
 Loss of appetite
 Occasional presence of blood in sputum 
(Haemoptysis)
In our community, old persons with all the above 
symptoms are generally neglected thinking that 
these are common symptoms of old age. But, 
whoever has the above symptoms should be suspected 
of having TB.
Vulnerable situations
 People with malnutrition
 People living in crowded areas like slums etc.
 People living in houses without proper ventilation
 People living in environmentally polluted areas
 People with HIV/AIDS
 Women and children are equally vulnerable 
Generally, all the poor are vulnerable as they have the maximum chances 
to fall into the above categories.
Under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control 
Programme, the following services are available:
 Sputum of person having cough for more than 
three weeks is examined three times in Microscopy 
centres. You should know the nearest microscopy 
centre. You may ask the ANM where they are so that you could guide a person to these places 
for sputum testing. 
 If sputum examination shows evidence of TB, anti- 
TB drugs are initiated. Duration of treatment would be as per doctor’s advice ranging from six months 
to nine months.
 In some cases, X-ray may be necessary and if it is 
positive, anti-TB drugs are given. 
Anti TB drugs are available at all district TB centres, TB clinics, government hospitals, district hospitals, Haemoptysis

CHCs, PHCs etc. Again you could check 
with the ANM for treatment of TB. Directly 
Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) 
centres have been established. They provide treatment free of cost, which is given under 
the supervision of the local ANM, MPW etc. 
or through voluntary workers. You are also 
supposed to work for this programme as a 
DOTS provider in future. A separate training will be given to you so that you know how 
to provide services under this programme.
TB can affect different organs in the body

Malaria is an illness caused 
by the presence of malarial 
parasite in the human body. 
It spreads through the bite of mosquito. When a mosquito 
bites a person suffering from 
malaria, the parasite enters 
the body of the mosquito. 
When the infected mosquito bites a healthy person then 
he/she may develop malaria. 
A  p e r s o n  w i t h  m a l a r i a 
generally has fever with chills daily/alternate day, generally with headache, bodyache and vomiting. The fever comes down with 
profuse sweating and leaves the person with generalized weakness 
and discomfort.

Wound can be of two types
a. Without bleeding : Abrasions, small cuts etc. 
b. With bleeding.
Any wound requires immediate care.
Following steps should be taken for wound care
 First clean the wound and the surrounding area with clean water. Use 
different cotton swabs for each cleaning.
 Wipe away the dirt with cotton gently, but do not rub it. Rubbing 
disturbs the clot and it can start bleeding again. 
 Make a rectangular pad using cotton 
between two layers of gauze. The 
diagonal of the rectangle should 
be one inch longer than the wound itself. Ask your trainer to teach you 
to make this. 
 If the wound is dry, then it need 
not be opened. 
 For sharp cuts, stitches may be 
needed. Usually simple stitching of small injuries can be done 
at nearby health facility. Such persons need to be sent to health facility.4
Wound Care

PAGE 196

17
 It is advised that all persons with wounds be given TT injection at the 
earliest at health facility. 
 For bad wounds, give first level care and refer to health facilities.
Sometimes you may need to control bleeding
 First, stop the bleeding. Press the wound with gauze or a clean cloth 
if the bleeding doesn’t stop.
 Clean the wound with cotton balls 
soaked in clean water. Cotton swabs 
should be just about wet. If you 
have no cotton, soft clean cotton cloth from sari or dhoti will do.
 If there is continuous bleeding from 
the wound then immediately refer 
to the nearest health facility.
Using local and home remedies
We have very good home remedies for wound care.
 Application of ice on bleeding wound until the bleeding stops.
 Haldi in oil is an excellent anti-septic. For abrasions and small cuts, 
application is enough. Dressing is not required in such cases.
 Aloe is a good wound healer and a natural dressing too. Cut a piece 
of aloe across its length and of the wound size. Put the raw cut side of aloe and tie it on the wound with cloth. Replace aloe dressing 
everyday.
 Application of neem oil is a good substitute. For bigger wounds, you 
may put it on the dressing pad.
 Raw papaya pieces can be an effective dressing. This is especially good 
for infected wounds.
 Triphala powder pressed on the wound stops small bleeds and also works as an antiseptic. You can wash the wounds also with Triphala 
kadha.
Your role and responsibilities : 
 To stop bleeding by application of pressure on the wound.
 Refer all patients with continuous bleeding for stitches to nearest health 
facility.WOUND CARE

Dog and animal bites: Will it be rabies?
Dog bite is greatly feared because it can give rise to a deadly illness, 
which is called rabies. This is an illness, which affects the brain. The 
victim fears water. This is due to severe spasm during swallowing. No 
cure is available for rabies. Anti Ra bies Va ccine (ARV) immediately after 
the dog bite can prevent the fatal illness. These vaccines are available in 
government hospitals. 
Not all dogs are rabid. Germs are present in the saliva of infected dogs. 
Some dogs get the infection from wild animals such as wolf or tiger. The 
infected dog passes it on to the other dogs. All infected animals finally 
die and may infect others in the meantime. Controlling stray dogs is the 
key to prevent rabies. Monkeys and other animals can also be infectious if they are rabid due to such bites.
Very effective and simple first aid for 
any dog bite is to:
 Wash the wound with soap and water 
thoroughly. This is most important. 
 Do not disturb the wound. Leave 
it open. Tie a loose dressing and 
advise to consult doctor/other staff 
in hospital. 5

Animal Bites

PAGE 198

How dangerous is the 
bite?
People will ask you if the 
bite is dangerous. A bite 
can cause illness only if the 
animal itself is infected. First symptoms of rabies in bitten 
person may appear early 
within 10 days or more after 
the bite. 
Rabies infection is likely if a 
pet dog dies within 10 days 
of the bite or if it shows any signs of rabies. Even 
a scratch on the skin may give rabies infection. Each wound is 
important. We can decide the risk of exposure as follows:
Mild:  Licks on normal skin, scratches without blood, drinking raw milk of 
s
uspect cattle.
Moderate:  Licks on fresh cuts, scratches with blood oozing, minor wounds 
f
ewer than five, all wounds except those on face, neck, head, palms and 
fingers.
Severe: All bites and scratches with oozing blood on neck, face, palms, 
f
ingers, face and head, Lacerated wounds on any part of body, wounds 
more than five, bites of wild animals.
If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as 
severe.
Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The effect of ARV reduces 
after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite, fresh vaccination is necessary. 
Rabies in dogs: Abnormal behaviour
Identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. Remember that there are two types of rabid dogs - the aggressive and the silent. The aggressive DOG AND OTHER ANIMAL BITES

PAGE 199

20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
kind keep biting and attacking humans and animals. They may refuse 
feeds but bite at wood or iron objects. They look ferocious. There is 
profuse salivation. 
Usually rabid animals act strangely. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes 
restless or irritable or attacking. Their mouth dribbles and froths and this 
fluid is highly infectious.
An originally aggressive dog may turn docile. The silent type languishes 
to death in neglected places. Wild animals may look friendly and turn to 
habitations. In case there are such problems in your area these need to 
be addressed and Gram Panchayats have to play the key role. 
Immunizing dogs
Immunization of dogs is essential. The protection given by vaccines used in the government veterinary services lasts for six months. Protection 
by newer vaccines lasts for one year. Those who handle dogs also need 
immunization every six months. A common problem is whether to use the milk of an animal bitten by a suspected dog or animal. The rabies germ is 
not reported in the milk of animals. It is completely destroyed by boiling, 
so milk of such animals is not harmful. However, the saliva of the animal 
will contain germs if infected by rabies. The key issue is to avoid direct 
contact of saliva of such animals.
Your role and responsibilities : 
 Wash the site of bite with soap and water thoroughly.
 Refer all cases of dog/other animal bites to facility where an anti-rabies 
vaccine is available.
 Advise people to get pet dogs vaccinated against rabies.

Burns are common injuries in India and women are the common 
victims. 
In some cases, the pressure stove is the culprit. In others it can be gas 
leak from the cylinder.
Children or women may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids 
— like milk, oil, dal, chai etc. 
Please note that some of the burn cases can be suicide attempts or 
attempt to murder. In any case, our priority should be to give first aid 
and take the person to hospital at the earliest. Inform the doctor about any 
information by the woman on the burn injury being intentional. In case, you know, do let her know about NGOs or counsellors she can approach for help. 
As necessary, the doctors will initiate legal measures in these cases. 
Burns: First Aid6
Common causes
 Kitchen accidents – commonly bursting of pressure stoves 
 Fire crackers 
 Explosion in work places 
 House fires

PAGE 201

22 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
 Chemical burns
 Electric burns
 Suicide attempts 
 Murder attempts
First aid and other help
First try to put out the flames. The 
immediate first aid for all kinds of 
burns is to pour plenty of cold water 
on the affected part, except on acid burns. This helps to reduce damage 
by absorbing heat from the skin. It 
also reduces pain to some extent. 
Water also helps by separating 
burning clothes from the skin. 
Many people wrongly believe that 
water causes blisters on the skin and instead they wrap the victim 
in blankets. This puts the fire off 
after some seconds, but does not 
absorb the heat. Water is far more effective than a blanket because it cools instantly.
If you are using water-soaked folds of clothes, place them on the burnt part and change them every three minutes. Help the victim to drink as 
much water as possible. This helps to overcome the shock caused by fluid 
loss from the body. Cover the burns with a clean cloth to protect from dust, flies, etc. Unless the burns are minor, all burn cases must be referred 
to hospitals. Facial burns and burn in hands should be referred.
You may have to treat small burns at home. Treat it like any other wound. 
Herbal applications like neem oil, coconut oil, aloe or raw papaya dressings are good. 
Prevention of burns
Prevention is better than cure. Think and start from your own home. Synthetic clothes catch fire quite quickly. They stick to the skin more

PAGE 202

23
Your role and responsibilities: 
 Pour plenty of cold water on the affected part
 Refer the patient to a hospital for further treatment
 Educate about safety measures specially while working with stoveseasily. Advise people to always take care regarding their clothes and sari 
pallus etc, during cooking.
Over-pumping the stove before pinning and igniting is dangerous. ‘First 
pin and then pump’ is the correct method to light the stove. BURNS: FIRST AID

In this chapter some remedies for AYUSH systems of healing are spelt out. 
The knowledge about these remedies will be useful for ASHAs for their 
day-to-day work in community.
Iron-deficiency disorders
Ayurveda has simple remedies to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia. Use 
of green leafy vegetables like spinach, Punarnnava , Sigru and fruits like 
Amalki , Dadim , dry grapes etc. in daily diet is important to prevent blood 
deficiency. ‘Mandookparni’  fried in ghee is also indicated to increase 
the RBC. Therapeutically, use of ‘Punarnnavadi mandura’  with water or 
buttermilk is indicated for minor and moderate anaemia. Anaemia in girls 
is a common cause for amenorrhoea. Therapeutically use of ‘Rajapravartini 
Vati’ 500mg. two tabs per day upto the onset of menstruation is beneficial 
in the condition. Three gms. powder of equal quantity of black tila (sesame), 
Shunti  and ghritakumari  (aloe) and one gm. jaggery with tepid water twice 
a day or decoction of above drugs including jaggery in the dose of 10-20 ml. twice a day is indicated for scanty menstruation. Anaemia caused 
due to excessive bleeding during menstruation could be managed by the intake of 
‘tanduliyaka’  (rice wash) with iron preparations like ‘mandura 
bhasma’  0.5 gm, or ‘Punarnavadi mandura’  0.5 gm and ‘Shukti Bhasma’  
0.5 gm. twice daily. 
Homoeopathic medicines improve absorption and thereby help in 
iron intake as supplement or from food rich in iron. Commonly used 7
AYUSH

PAGE 204

25
homoeopathic medicines for iron deficiency anaemia are given below with 
their indications.
 Arsenic album: Anaemia due to malaria, excessive prostration, oedema, 
violent and irregular palpitation.
 Calcarea carbonicum: Palpitation & tachycardia, vertigo, anorexia, 
nausea, eructation; Pale, weak fatigue, lassitude, easily tired; Headache 
and heaviness at morning, profuse sweating on head.
 China: Chief remedy for anaemia resulting from loss of fluids, as in 
lactation or haemorrhage, or from all exhausting discharges, such as menstrual flow, long-lasting diarrhoea.
 Ferrum metallicum: Paleness of the face and puffiness of the extremities, 
weakness, easily exhausted.
 Ferrum phosphoricum: Anaemia and chlorosis; it removes the underlying 
dyscrasia giving rise to the anaemic or chlorotic conditions and cures the trouble.
 Kali carbonicum: Anaemia after loss of fluid or vitality; Pallor; Aversion 
to be alone; Backache, weakness, profuse menses, irregular with clots, weak before menstruation; Backache; Vertigo.
 Natrum muriaticum: Anaemic and debilitated conditions due to loss 
of fluids, especially in women who suffer from menstrual disorders.
 Phosphorus: Anaemia; Morning diarrhoea; Restlessness; Weakness 
and prostration; Nervousness, debility and trembling; Nausea and vomiting.
 Pulsatilla: Anaemic condition produced by large or continued doses of 
iron; System is relaxed and worn out; Patient suffering from gastric and menstrual derangements.
Some Unani medicines are also commonly used for supplementing iron in pregnant ladies, mothers and children. Sharbat-e-Faulad 15ml. twice daily 
is indicated for pregnant ladies and mothers. In children the medicine 
could be given in the dose of 5 ml. twice daily. Qurs-e-Damvi two tablets 
with butter is also useful for this purpose.
Iron deficiency disorders can be managed as well as prevented by a proper 
intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.AYUSH

PAGE 205

26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA
Iron rich foods 
Green leafy vegetables, spinach, ragi, jaggery, drumstick, dates raisins, amla 
and figs etc. For enhancing the absorption of iron, one must take whole 
grams, sprouts, fresh fruits and fresh raw vegetables. Intake of tea, coffee 
and other preservatives in the food interfere in the absorption of iron. So by avoiding all the beverages, we can enhance the iron absorption. 
Diseases of gastro-intestinal system
Gastro-intestinal system plays an important role in the normal and abnormal states of health. Ayurveda describe that the use of wholesome 
diet is the only factor that promotes the healthy growth of man. Food 
should be taken at proper time, when the body feels light after the digestion of previous meals, after the clearance of bowels and urine and 
when the mind is free from worries. Clean and hygienic food should be 
taken in optimum quantity. The food should not be too hot or too cold, 
too heavy or too light. 
Diseases of the gastro-intestinal system are primarily caused by the food 
and water that we take. The root causes of many chronic diseases are 
also related to factors derived from partially digested or undigested food materials. Therefore, the disorders arising from gastro-intestinal tract 
should be promptly managed. If digestive capacity is low simple remedies 
like ‘Trikatu’ and ‘Panchakola’ powders 2 gms.twice daily are indicated for use along with warm water before meals. In abdominal pain due to 
indigestion, Hinguvachadi Churna, Lashunadi Vati, Chitrakadi Vati etc. is 
indicated in the dose of two tablets twice daily with warm water.
Constipation is a common symptom of many illnesses, which can be 
managed by powder of ‘Triphala’ (equal quantity of fruits of amla, harada 
and baheda) 5 gms. with tepid water at bedtime. 8-10 dried grapes of 
bigger variety boiled with about 250 ml. of milk is also indicated at bedtime for relieving constipation.
Unani medicines are widely used for the management of abdominal 
distension and gastritis. Qurs-e-Tankar or Qurs-e-Kabid is indicated one 
tablet twice daily in this condition. Qurs-e-Alkali one tablet twice daily 
may be used as an antacid. In non-specific diarrhoea Qurs-e-Zaheer one 
tablet twice daily is useful. In case of amoebiasis Qurs-e-Deedau one 
tablet twice daily is indicated.

PAGE 206

Naturopathy and yoga systems provide various ways to keep the gastro-
intestinal tract in a good condition. Naturopathy teaches us to take the 
foods, which are natural, easy to digest, absorb and eliminate. According 
to naturopathy, nutritious and harmless food should be taken for proper digestion, absorption and elimination. Hydrotherapy, mud therapy and 
massage therapy helps to strengthen the digestive system and to eliminate 
the toxins from the digestive system.HOMOEOPATHIC DRUGS IN DIARRHOEA, NAUSEA

function of the digestive system. Kriyas, the cleansing process, eliminates 
the toxins and waste materials from the GIT.
Rational drugs
Ayurveda explains the therapeutics as basically two kinds – one kind is promotive of vigour in the healthy; the other, destructive of the disease 
in the ailing. A drug while inducing therapeutic effect, should not evoke 
untoward effects. In this regard, herbal drugs like Ashwagandha, Shatavari, Guduchi, Vasaka, Hareetaki, Amalki, Vibheetaki, Ginger etc. could be 
considered as safe drugs.
Some common AYUSH medicines
We have seen that the knowledge about the use of medicinal plants 
obtained from our surroundings is valuable. Let us study about some more 
remedies commonly used in the country.
Hingu (Ferula foetida Regel.) 
Hingu consists of gum resin obtained from rhizomes and roots of a 
perennial herb occurring in Persia and Afghanistan. Hing is commonly 
found in our kitchens and is used as a condiment. However, it would be 
interesting to know that it is also used as a digestive and is useful in common disorders like abdominal pain, flatulence and worm infestation. 
In infants, hing mixed with breast milk is given orally for relieving pain 
abdomen. Hing mixed with a little mustard oil can be applied gently over 
the abdomen and a little piece of hing can be put over umbilicus for 
relieving pain in abdomen. Hingwashtaka Churna, which contains hing as main ingredient, half teaspoon mixed with luke warm water could be given 
two-three times a day in abdominal pain and worm infestation.
Jatiphala (Myristica fragrans Houtt.) 
Jatiphala consists of kernels of fruits from Myristica fragrans, an aromatic 
tree commonly found in southern India. The fruit kernels are commonly 
used in dysentery, diarrhoea and vomiting. For vomiting, powder of Jatiphal 
mixed with tulsi juice and 1 gm. honey could be given two-three times a day. In diarrhoea and dysentery, powder of equal quantity of parched 
saunf (Shatapushpa), Jatiphala and sugar in the dose of 2 gm. three or 
four times with cold water or scum of rice should be given.

Knowing
Myself
Understanding oneself is crucial to know about one’s own personality and
temperament, our strengths, limitations and areas for development. Theprocess of knowing oneself is continuous and we need to review our strengthsand limitations from time to time, which will help us to change. We need toconstantly grow in our capacities in order to ensure that we are able tofacilitate the process of development and empowerment at the community
level too. However before we attempt to empower the community we need
to know whether we are empowered ourselves.
Remember we were created by nature with a unique body, soul and mind. All
human beings have different characteristics and personalities. The externalenvironment influences our personality. As  women, directly or indirectly, weare told that ours is a subordinate role. We usually do not question this kind of
attitude towards us. In fact, we are not trained to question the daily
inequality that we face. We accept the social norms without any questioning.A woman who questions them, is viewed as “out of control.”
Let us understand how this attitude affects our personality. In our Indian
society a woman is identified by her relationship with others, like that of adaughter, mother, wife, etc. Being brought up in a patriarchal society, a
woman internalises these norms, which makes her devalue herself. She does
not think of herself as worthwhile and neglects all her needs. All this affectsher self-esteem and overall personality.

PAGE 218

6As a woman you must have experienced that you are expected to be humble,
to put your needs after that of other people, to learn to say “yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval.
This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your
journey as an ASHA you need to first identify your own needs in order to be
able to understand and appreciate the needs of others.
Let Us Understand the Meaning of Self-Esteem
Self-esteem refers to the perception that  you have about  yourself.  It is about
how much  you  value  yourself  and  how  important  you  think  you are.
zIt is about being confident about and satisfied with your own self.
zIt is about a reasonable sense of your self-worth.
zIt is about having faith in yourself and your abilities.
zIt is about being pleased with yourself and with your achievements.
Remember, it is NOT about
zConvincing yourself that you are of value
zFeeling confident or feeling good when other people praise you
zHaving beautiful features
Let us examine the characteristics of a person with healthy self-esteem:
zSelf-confidence
zAbility to express true feelings
zAbility to recognise and value own accomplishments
zAbility to forgive self and others
zAbility to welcome change
If you do not take care of yourself, respect who you are and respect your own
needs, you will not be able to take care of others and respect their needs.
Give some time to know yourself. There is a need to go through the process
of self-realisation. It will help you to build up a healthy self-esteem.
Maintain a diary about your dealing with others and yourself during the day.The process of understanding the self and self-realisation is continuos and one
needs to do it systematically.

PAGE 219

7Think about the following questions. Answering them will help you in self-
reflection. More questions may be added.
zWhat are some of the difficulties that I face in order to complete my
work?
zWhat are some of the changes which I will practice if I have to deal with
this situation again? (The changes can be related to behaviour, way of
working, etc.)
zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why?
zWhat did I do today which has made me happy?
Remember , each day must contribute to your overall goals in some way. Each
day must in some way be connected to the rest of your life. Each day shouldcontribute to your general welfare, happiness and empowerment. This will
also contribute to the development of your community. We have 24 hours in a
day, out of which we spend about seven hours sleeping. Out of the remaining17 hours, we need to think about how many we actually spend on self-development. As an ASHA we suggest that you initially need atleast half anhour everyday for yourself in order to grow and develop. You may increasethis period as you get more familiar with this practice. We need to plan for
our self-development from today. You may use the tools given here for help.

made for self-development as per your plan. If you have not been able todo it, think about the reasons. Reflect on what you will do differently so
that you do not come up with these reasons again.
Try to maintain a diary and write down the important steps that you have
taken to develop yourself, what difficulties you faced and how youovercame them.
You may share your self-development plan with a person whom you trust.
You may take regular feedback from that person to learn whether she/he
has noticed the changes in you.
Note:  Once you achieve what you had planned, develop a new plan and
follow the same steps .

PAGE 221

9Some Tips to Achieve your Goal
zBe passionate about your goal. Passion is the energy that drives us. Let
your passion carry you, because it will carry you far!
zBe persistent; never give up!
zIf you want to enjoy the beautiful view from the top, you will have toclimb over every obstacle. If you are not prepared for this, stay at basecamp!
zLove people and treat them with respect and honour. Without them it is
impossible to achieve the goals of development. Along with a strong will,passion and persistence, you need to feel competent in your skills. Developthe most appropriate skills. Average skills will get you to the middle. Topskills will let you achieve your final goal. Make sure that you are growingday-by-day, month-by-month, year-by-year. You can always learn new
things. Even if you only improve a little at the beginning it will keep
accumulating and eventually become a large amount!
zAs an ASHA, demand the best from yourself and from others. Unlike a
common person, an excellent person makes great demands on herself/himself.
zAs an ASHA you are unique.You are talented and skilled and, therefore, you
have been selected to serve the community. Make maximum use of your
potential and make sure that you achieve your goals. You need to have astrong will. A strong WILL can move mountains.

ASHA as a
Health Activist
Your role as an activist to improve the access of marginalised and
disadvantaged community members to public health care services is very
important. Before we discuss your role in detail, let us visualise a situation.
Rami lives next to your house. She is five months pregnant. She is very weak,
but has not registered her name with the ANM. Rami does not receive any
healthcare services. Her husband is a drunkard. Everyday he drinks and shouts
at Rami, sometimes even beats her.
You feel uncomfortable and want to stop this. You discuss this with other
women in your neighbourhood. They understand your point of view. Together
you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectivelygo and stop him.
You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens
again, you would inform the police.
Next day when the ANM (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife)  comes, you take Rami with
you and register her name.
Well, admittedly a real situation does not get handled this smoothly, but you
will never know just how it will fare unless you try it out. You need to take
the first step towards bringing about change. Initially you will be alone but
slowly, with your efforts of creating awareness through one-to-one approachor by addressing the issue in the village meetings you will have many to
support you in your endeavour.

PAGE 223

11The above effort is an example to explain “activism”
As an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist. So it is important
to understand how it is done. Read the following real life examples ofactivism.
Anti Arrack Movement
In 1991, women from Dubagunta, Nellore district of the Indian state of
Andhra Pradesh, drove away the liquor contractors from their village. This
is said to have been the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor)Movement, which finally led to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on16 January 1995.
The main participants in the early struggle were poor rural women,
predominantly from scheduled castes and backward classes, supported by
voluntary organisations and, later, by politicians from opposition parties.
This is not just a story, it actually happened. It is about what a miracle that
common women were able to achieve collectively. It is about a communityof hard-working women who laboured in the fields to earn their living.Unfortunately, all their labour was wasted on arrack and toddy (locallymade liquor). The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that
they not only spent money on it, but also sold the hard earned food
materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), inexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris.
After drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and
children making their lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless.
There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to gostraight to these shops in the evening after returning from work. Theycame home late at night, completely drunk.They would hand over somemoney for household expenses only if there was any left.
The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition,
stabbed his father to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman
of this community was embarrassed when her relatives visited her houseand, to her shame, were scared away from the village by the obscenelanguage of her closest neighbor, a heavy drinker. She felt ashamed andthought that the village would be a much better place without arrack.
Everyday while working in the fields and at the community wells the
women discussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together
and approached the village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders.They expressed their problem and asked them to get r emove the arrack and
toddy shops. The elders and the Sarpanch, although agree able, were unable to
do anything

PAGE 224

12The next day one hundred of the women gathered together. They went to
the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come intothe village’, they told the cart driver strongly in unison and stood in frontof it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them offered him a rupee to doso.The driver got scared and left the village.
Then a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and
demanded that it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the
police were called. They said that all those who bid at auctions have theright to sell arrack.The women stood unmoved. They said that they wouldgo to the Collector and will not keep quiet if arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet. They made several plans, butnothing worked and they gave up.
These events gave strength to the women. All this happened only because
the women united and struggled strongly to get rid of arrack from theirvillage.
The story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of
the district.
In the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the
community through puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They
also shared the story of Dubagunta village.
Women of other villages had also suffered a lot. There were quarrels every
day in their families.They survived only by taking refuge in neighbouringhouses. Daily, for two-three hours they had to put up with this situation.There was not enough food for their children. So, women in other villages
considered doing in their village what the women in Dubagunta had done
earlier. The members of three literacy centres discussed this issue. Theteachers supported and guided them. Finally, they also attacked the arrackshops.
They too managed to stop the arrack business in their village.The women in
Dubagunta initiated and led a movement in which women from other
villages joined and ultimately the situation changed for the better.
Chipko Movement
The Chipko Movement was initiated in the Uttarakhand region of India by a
group of villagers who opposed the commercial cutting down of trees. Themovement was led by women who were influenced by Mahatma Gandhi.
For rural women, saving the environment is crucial to their economic
survival. As primary food, fuel and water gatherers, women have strong
interests in reversing deforestation, desertification and water pollution.The women made a living in the Himalayan foothills, using its forests assources of food and fuel. They faced a particularly severe challenge in the

PAGE 225

131960s, when India, to enhance economic development, started to cut trees
to export the wood and earn foreign exchange. As a consequence, the hillsoil washed away, causing landslides, floods and silting in the rivers belowthe hills. Crops and houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies.
Against these harmful deforestation policies a movement called Chipko was
born. “Chipko” in Hindi means to cling, reflecting the protesters’ maintechnique of throwing their arms around the tree trunks marked to be cut,and refusing to move. In a remote hill town a contractor had been giventhe right by the state to fell 3000 trees for a sporting goods store. The areawas already becoming barren. The women of the village decided to fight
against this. When the woodcutters were scheduled to arrive, the men were
lured away from the village leaving the women at home, busy withhousehold work. As soon as the woodcutters appeared, the alarm wassounded and the village's female leader, a widow in her 50s, collected 27women and rushed to the forest. The women pleaded with the woodcuttercalling the forest their “maternal home” and explaining the consequences
of felling trees. The woodcutters shouted at and abused the women and
threatened them with guns. The women in turn threatened to hug themarked trees and die with them. It worked! The frightened labourers leftand the contractor backed off. In 1974, women in a nearby area used thesame tree-hugging technique in order to protest against the clearing oftheir forestlands.
Similarly, in your community you may come across several issues that require
to be addressed. For example, the anganwadi is not functioning well; childrenand women are not receiving their entitlement of supplementary food; themidday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly. It could be thatwidow pension is not being received in spite of all the required formalitiesbeing completed by the widows of the village. So, to bring change in such
situations, some collective action is required.
However, activism or protest is not the first step in any process towards
change. First, one needs to understand the situation and find out if thingscan be changed through simply drawing the attention of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue.
For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like
the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter
in order to resolve it.
Activism may not always be the best method of changing the world but it can
be quite useful under the right circumstances. It gives voice to a cause.
Activism is particularly useful/effective when you have many people who are
affected with the same issues and the situation needs to be changed. If you

PAGE 226

14decide to initiate a movement along with the people to change a situation,
first see if there is some organisation or institute working on the same issueand try and seek their support or join them in their efforts.
As an ASHA there are Some Key Principles that You Need
to Keep in Mind in Activism to Bring about Change
1. Identify and work on the issues that are most crucial and urgent and are
affecting the larger community.
2. Involve the people who are affected and ensure that they cooperate with
you.
3. Let it be a people’s movement and struggle rather than an individual effort4. Mobilising the community takes time and will be energy consuming. Do not
lose patience and hope.

PAGE 227

Values of
ASHA
For every individual, values are the central guiding force for all behaviour and
attitudes. Culture, experience, education, religion, law, language and media
influence values. It is also important to know that values can change. Whileworking on social issues, we are basically working with the attitudes andbehaviours of the community and the programme implementors for a positiveand desired change. Hence, it becomes very important to address the valuesof individuals for social development.
Every individual has her/his own values. There is noth ing like  right or wrong.
Generally, they are received from our parents, our society and oursurroundings. Values shape our personality and  identity and are directly
connected with our vision of life. They guide us to decide our goal and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads.
Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are  lost and confused. For
example, whether to spend time in gossiping or in my work will depend on myvalues.
Values remain in the subconscious mind and act like red and green traffic
lights.They tell us what we should or should not do. Values are a set of beliefsabout what is good and desirable. They are based on assumptions about how
the world works. Our idea of what is the right thing to do in a situation
comes from these values.

PAGE 228

16Some examples of values which are required for social development include:
1. Value of Equality
zIn a patriarchal society women are viewed as submissive, weak and soft
and men as strong and powerful. Due to this thinking men are given morerecognition, power and respect in the family and society whereas womenare usually viewed in a supportive role. As a result, girls and woman haveless access to resources. For example, girls and women are given less food
than boys and men of the family.
Men and boys are given more scope to develop themselves, e.g., men
are given more opportunity for basic and higher education. Men, usually
   inherit the properties of the family, while women usually do not get
a share.
If you believe in patriarchal values you will not see anything wrong if a
woman is ill-treated. If you believe in equality you will respect a woman as
a person.
zIn our society the structure of caste is very strong and people who arefrom a socially advantaged class are in favour of maintaining status quo.Due to the caste structure, certain people of our society do not getopportunities to develop and get the benefits of the mainstream. As an
ASHA we have to first understand problems of the poor and marginalised
communities. They need to be educated about their rights andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion.
2. Value of Responsibility
zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own health
and that of your family and community. You may keep your own house
    clean and throw garbage in the street, which is not responsible behaviour.    As a member of the community you need to throw garbage at the    designated place so as to prevent infectious diseases.
zThe Sarpanch of your village has the power to make decision for thedevelopment of your village. Many times people misuse this power and use
it for their own benefit or benefit of their friends, relatives and/or
    caste.Being responsible for your own self and to the power you are    designated with is very important. No system works effectively if all the    designated  members do not perform their duties effectively and in a
 coordinated manner.
3. Believe in People’s Knowledge and Experience
All people have experience and knowledge. It needs to be respected and
valued while making any decision. Never view people as empty vessels needing

PAGE 229

17to be filled with knowledge. They should not be viewed as passive recipients.
They need to be active in sharing their views while making decisions. Forexample, if pregnant women are not coming forward to get their namesregistered you will need to find out why they are not coming. Ask them tosuggest strategies to increase registration of pregnant women and how theycould contribute to making the strategy work.
4. Values of Trust
When people honour each other, there is a trust established that leads tosynergy, interdependence and mutual respect. Gaining the trust of thosearound you is not a difficult or unachievable task. Trust can be created bysharing feelings, thoughts, views and being transparent. Trust is a glue thatholds people together.
Some of the values promoted by Mahatma Gandhi
zAlways speak the truth
zBelieve in the power of non-violence
zA person should not be discriminated against on the basis of her or his
caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being.
zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness.
zNever misuse common resources like land, water, forests, wood, etc. Itbelongs to every individual on earth and all should have equal  access tothese resources.
zYou can touch the heart of people if you are committed to serve them.
zKeep people at the centre of your activities and believe in the power ofpeople.
It is a fact that people who are conscious of their value-based priorities are
more fulfilled and happier in their lives. They make more effective decisionsabout their own and their family and community’s growth and development.To know your personal values is to be more aware of who you are, what you
want and what you don’t want.
As an ASHA, your work is very important. With that you should also value your
family and community. You also need to think about what is more importantto you and why. Answering these questions for yourself can be revealing. Insome situations the family may be important and in some it may be thework. One is actually a means to another. Working together may enable you
to support your family, providing you an opportunity to develop. Having a
family may provide support to your work. Understanding your values enablesyou to move ahead and maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.

Understanding the
Human Rights andthe Fundamental
Rights
Every individual needs to have knowledge about their Human and their
Fundamental Rights. Usually we do not come across information on this topic.Also, in the past you may not have discussed this topic with others. As anASHA you need to know about rights. It will help you to learn about your andyour community’s rights. It will also help you to take appropriate decisions forthe development of your community. You may be reading about Fundamental
and Human Rights for the  first time and you may find the information
boring. We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make theinformation  simple, interesting and relevant.
Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not
respect you. These include things people may have said about you to makeyou feel stupid or silly. For example, some one may have told you, “There is
no use talking to you, you will not understand.” Try and remember one or two
such hurtful statements/incidents.  
In 1948, after the global suffering in World War II, all the countries in the
world agreed that it would be a more peaceful world if every human beingrespected the dignity of every other human being. As a result, the UniversalHuman Right Declaration came in existence. Our country has also agreed to
this Declaration.

PAGE 231

19This the set of the Universal Human Rights.
zAll human beings are born free and equal.  
zEveryone should have the same rights and freedom, no matter of what
race, sex, or colour she or he may be. It should not matter where wewere born, what language we speak or what religion or political opinions
we have, or whether we are rich or poor.
zEveryone has the right to live, to be free and to feel safe.
zAdult men and women have the right to marry and start a family, without
anyone trying to stop them because of their race, country or religion.Both have to agree to the marriage and both have equal rights in getting
married, during the marriage, and if and when they decide to end it.
zYou may believe what you want to believe, have ideas about right and
wrong, and believe in any religion you want, and you may change yourreligion if you want, without interference.
The entire list of Human Rights is long and we shall not be discussing it here.
Let us now understand what are the Fundamental Rights.
The Fundamental Rights
As an Indian, our county has granted us six Fundamental Rights. They are:
zRight to Equality
zRight to Freedom
zRight against Exploitation
zRight to Freedom of Religion
zCultural and Educational Rights
zRight to Constitutional Remedies
Let us understand these rights in detail.
The Right to Equality
The state cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of race, caste,
sex, religion or place of birth. The state also cannot discriminate againstanyone in matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs.But the Right to Equality specifies certain expectations. The Constitution has
a special provision in the form of reserve posts while guaranteeing the Right
to Equality. Reserved posts are provided for scheduled castes, scheduled tribesand other backward classes. Similarly, special provisions are provided forwomen and children.
The main reason for having these exceptions is that in our society various
kinds of inequalities still exist. You must have noticed how people become
victims of unequal treatment. Extending such protections does not contradict

PAGE 232

20the spirit of the Right to Equality. Such a policy is known as ‘Positive
Discrimination’ or a ‘Protective Discrimination’ policy.
Right to Freedom
The Right to Freedom is a cluster of the following six freedoms:
Freedom of speech and expression
Freedom to assemble peacefully and without armsFreedom to form associations or unions
Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India
Freedom to live and settle in any part of IndiaFreedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or
business.
The aim of the Right to Freedom is the development of a person. She/he
should enjoy her/his rights democratically, and She/he should be able to live a
healthy and civic life. This right is very crucial for democracy.
Right Against Exploitation
When we accept everyone as human, we cannot treat anyone as a ‘slave’.
She/he cannot be kept in captivity. She/he cannot be forced into labour.Citizens are protected against such exploitation by the law. Earlier there waspractice of bonded or forced labour. Sometimes such traditions were carriedon for generations. The forced labour system has now been abolished.
Practice of  this system is a crime which is punishable by law.
In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work
beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and is a crime under the Abolition ofChild Labour Act.
Right to Freedom of Religion
The Right to freedom of religion provides religious freedom to all the citizens
of India. All religions are equal before the state and no religion can be given
preference over the other by the state.
However, religious freedom also has to be observed under certain limitations.
The state can regulate the non-religious activities of any religious communityin the interest of public order, morality and health.
Cultural and Educational Rights
India is a country of multiple religions, languages and cultures. Any community
which has a language and script of its own, has the right to conserve and
develop them. All minorities, religious or linguistic groups, can set up their

PAGE 233

21own educational institutions. In doing so, they may preserve and develop their
own culture.
Right to Constitutional Remedies
This right empowers citizens to approach the court in cases of denial of anyof the Fundamental Rights. The court of law stands as a guard against theviolation of these rights.
Under this right, it is the duty of the Judiciary to attend to all complaints
pertaining to violation or rights.
Directive Principles
Apart from these there are some Directive Principles of State Policy that
incorporate such rights as are required for the overall development of human
kind.
zThese Principles include rights like the right to work, right to equal wage
for equal work, right to an adequate livelihood, right to free and
compulsory education of children up to the age of 14 years etc.
zThe state should take measures to preserve the good health of labourersand minor children and to ensure that they are not forced to undertake
any work that harms their health.
zThe state should promote public health and animal husbandry.
zDecentralisation of power should reach the grassroots level. For that,
Panchayati Raj must be established.
zThe state should protect the academic and economic benefits of theweaker sections. Not only that, various programmes should be undertaken
for the development of these people. In addition to that, free legal
assistance should be extended to the economically weaker sections of
society to help get them justice.
Think about the following statements and decide whether your Human and
community’s Fundamental Rights are protected.
zMy village is safe and secure.  All members of the community receive equaltreatment and information about different government schemes and
opportunities so as to avail of these services.
zMy village provides all its inhabitants equal access to resources, especially
water, irrespective of their caste, sex and religion.
zWhenever someone violates the rights of another person, the villagecommittee takes note of it, discusses and takes appropriate decision andaction with the consent of all the committee members, keeping in view the
policies and procedures of the committee.

PAGE 234

22zAll members of the village are allowed to attend the Gram Panchayat.
Are your attending the Gram Panchayat?
zNo one in your village is subjected to degrading treatment or punishment.
zMy village Panchayat has people from diverse backgrounds, religion andcultures. There are some women members in our Panchayat. There are33% seats reserved in the Panchayat for women.
zI can express my  political, religious and cultural ideas and beliefs to myfamily and community without fear of discrimination.
zMembers of my village actively participate in decision-making processesrelated to village and community development through the village GramSabha.
zThe village members and labourers are paid as per minimum wage norms.
zBoth men and women are paid equal wages for equal work.

Understanding
the Meaningof the Rightto Health
We have discussed the meaning of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights.
This discussion was conducted to have basic information on rights. Now we
need to discuss the meaning of the Right to Health. As an ASHA you need tohave knowledge about your right to health. This will help you to mobilise acommunity to access its entitlements and be vigilant. Your understanding ofthe Right to Health will help you to take action to access health care servicesfrom the Public Health System.
Let us first understand the meaning of the Right to Health.
Right to Health Means
zThere should be public healthcare facilities in place with adequate
amount of drugs and equipment. This facility needs to be functionaland implementing comprehensive and gender sensitive health programmes
zHealth facilities and services have to be accessible to everyone
without any discrimination.
zNobody should be refused treatment on the basis of religion, caste,
economic status, gender, etc.
zThe public health facility should be located such that it can be reached at
the earliest convenience.
zThe health services should be affordable for the majority of the people.

PAGE 236

24zThe public health services should be available free of cost.
zInformation about the services available should be accessible to community
members irrespective of their caste/class/religion/sex. They should beaware about their entitlements from the Public Health System.
zAll health services should be gender-sensitive and address an individual’slife-cycle needs and requirements.
zHealth facilities and services must be scientifically and medicallyappropriate and of good quality.
Answer the following questions to know whether or not your community’s
rights to health are protected:
zIs the health service available free of cost to all the community members
through the Public Health System?
zDoes your ANM visit your village regularly and visit all the area of yourcommunity to provide free health services?
zIs the health facility located at a place which can be reached easily?
zIs the health service financially affordable for the  majority of the people inthe community?
zIs the community aware about all the health services and entitlements that
they can avail of from the Public Health System?
zIs the community aware of the maternal benefit schemes like Janani
Suraksha Yojana (JSY) or any other health schemes being implemented bythe government?
If the answers to these questions are “NO”, it means that your community’s
Right to Health is not protected. If your community members have to pay for
the health services from the Public Health System, their Right to Health is not
protected. As an ASHA, if you do not know the answer to the abovementioned questions, get the information from the community by discussingthese matters with them. You are a critical link between the community andthe Health Facility. To exercise the  community’s Right to Health you alsoneed to monitor, identify gaps and articulate their health care needs to the
appropriate health care providers. Therefore, you need to be well aware of
the health structure, systems and its operational issues and standards.
Different health services are available at various levels. Let us first learn
about them. Usually the health services are available at the state, district,cluster and village levels.
Village level
At the village level there is a Sub-Centre. It provides the following health

State Level
At state-level policies, plans and programmes are formulated based on theinformation and research regarding the health needs and problems of the
people. Appropriate budgets for those services, materials and human
resources are allocated.
Quality of care: Now you know about the health services which are available
at these different levels. As an ASHA you need to be well-versed with servicesavailable at the Sub-Centre and the PHC. Knowing only about the services isalso not enough. Under the Rural Health Mission great emphasis is being put
on the quality of health care. As an ASHA you need to make sure that your
community members receive quality health care. There are certain normswhich need to be followed by the health service providers and health careservice institutions provide quality care to patients. Generally, patients do notknow about these. As a result, they often get poor quality services.
Quality Health Care is a Right of the Community
zA professionally trained and certified person has to take history and
examine the patient.
zThe patient is to be given appropriate/adequate information related to the
diagnosis, treatment procedures and drugs prescribed without scaringor causing undue tension.

PAGE 240

28zThe patient needs to be given time to share concerns. After listening to
them, help them to make an informed decision regarding their treatmentand any procedure (risk and safety factors) and choose the most suitablealternative if there is a choice available.
zThe essential equipment, supplies and technical staff must be availableat the facility. Patient/s must not be told that due to unavailability
of drugs or equipment being out of order s/he cannot receive the
necessary service.
zPrivacy, comfort, confidentiality, and dignity of the patient are to bemaintained- have curtains in examination rooms, allow the patient’srelatives and family to  accompany her/him, if desired, and keepregisters/files locked.
zBehaviour of the health care providers need to be courteous,non-discriminatory and reassuring.
zPatient must feel motivated enough by the health care providers and thesystem to continue and complete the treatment.
zAppropriate and adequate treatment is be given.
It is very important that you visit your nearby sub-center and PHC regularly to
learn whether these centres are providing quality basic health services. Your
visit needs to be well-planned. We have given a checklist in Annexure 1, whichyou should carry while visiting these centres. Observe the aspects mentionedin this checklist. If you observe that the PHC and sub-centre are not providingquality health care services you have a right to discuss the same with themedical officer in-charge and the ANM. If you do not get proper responses
from them you can go to the Block Health Officer or Chief Medical Officer
and bring your concerns to their notice. Make a note of the names of all thepeople with whom you speak.

Whenever we think of a leader , who comes to mind first? It may be a great
freedom fighter , a popular politician or a renowned religious guru. All thesepeople have some common qualities, they alter a challenging situation or a
problem into an opportunity.
Leadership can be defined as mobilising people and resources towards
achieving valued goals. Through knowledge and experience most people have
the potential to become a leader in any given situation.
Effective leadership in the community requires skills like team building,
communication, conflict resolution, negotiation and advocacy for change.
As an ASHA you often have to play the role of a leader. Hence it is important
to understand the meaning of leadership and qualities, which will help you in
playing your leadership roles effectively.
Leadership means
zto be responsible
zto inspire people to follow you
zto be non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions
zto show confidence, assertiveness, enthusiasm, passion and accountability
zto have skills for getting things done in cooperation with others
Leadership

PAGE 245

33Gandhiji was a great leader. He took people along with him to achieve freedom
for our country. Let us see the principles that he followed as a leader.
Courage: Courage to stand up and be accountable for your beliefs
and opinions
If your community’s Right to Health is violated, as an ASHA you need to have
courage to bring it to the notice of the concerned stakeholders. For example,if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting thehouses of socially backward families have courage to tell her that you havenoted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. If
she does not listen, be ready to inform the Sarpanch, SHG members and even
the medical officer. Continue your efforts till you ensure that she  visits all thepeople in your village regularly.
Responsibility:  Carry out your role and responsibility honestly
As a leader you need to be responsible, first person for your self and then foryour community. As an ASHA you are given specific roles and responsibilities.You should inform your community of these. This will prove useful in two
ways:
zIf they are aware about your roles they will be able to bring it to your
notice if you are not performing it effectively.
zThey will also support you in carrying out your roles and responsibilitiesmore effectively
Encouragement: Invite the community to join you in availing of their
right to quality health care
Every individual needs encouragement. As a leader, whenever you meet
anyone read the unwritten words on their forehead “I am important.”
Encouragement comes by involving community members in the process whenavailing for them their entitlements from the public health system or bygiving them some responsibility to improve the health environment in thecommunity.
Improvement: Constantly enhancing your competencies
As a leader, an ASHA should constantly improve her knowledge and skills. Be
aware of any new decision made regarding the delivery of health services and
any new schemes declared. Be in constant dialogue with the ANM as she is agood source of information. Your skills will improve by practising them. Youmay fail too. From failures you learn what should not be done. If you arerepeating your mistakes it means that you are not learning. By learning youwill be able to stand out.

PAGE 246

34Leadership Style
People adopt different leadership styles. The two common styles are
zAuthoritarian
zParticipatory
Authoritarian leaders do not come forward for cooperation or collaboration.
They are heavily task-oriented people. They expect people to do what they
are told without question or debate. They  are usually intolerant of what they
do not agree with. It is difficult for community members to contribute theirviews or empower themselves under this kind of leadership.
A participatory leader creates a positive environment in which all members
can reach their highest potential. They encourage the community to reachthe set goals as effectively as possible, while also working tirelessly to
strengthen the bonds among various members. They usually form and lead
some of the most productive teams.
As an ASHA, it is the most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership
style. Some of the characteristics of participatory leadership are given below:
Leaders establish goals and set the direction
As an ASHA you need to articulate what is an achievable goal in your village.You should establish your goal and direction by involving your community as to
how, where and when it would be completed.
For example, there should not be any maternal death in the coming year in
your village, or, All children of your village should be immunised in the next sixmonths.
Leaders affirm and articulate values
As leaders we need to have certain values like honesty, hardwork,trusteworthiness etc. You have to demonstrate these values in your actions.
You may communicate to your community members that you are hardworking
but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you.
For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be
fully immunised. But when the ANM comes for immunisation you are notpresent.Then will people believe that you are a hardworking person?
Leaders have high standards and high expectations
As an ASHA you should be firm about receiving high quality health care
services from the sub-centre and the PHC for your village community.
Make sure that the ANM performs her role professionally. As an ASHA you
should also provide her support to carry out her role effectively. For example,

PAGE 247

35inform the community about the date and place of the health camp or day of
visit of the ANM and encourage them to be present at the camp.
If the health service provider ill-treats a community member, take a note of
it and confront the person concerned.
Leaders are accountable and responsible
As an ASHA you are accountable, both to the community and the health careprovider. Be an effective link between both of them by sharing information
from one end to the other.
Some tips to be accountable:
zYou will gain personal power and the ability to get results if you assume
accountability in all situations, even if you do not immediately see theresults.
zComplain only to the person who can do something about it.
zConcentrating on blaming others or complaining will reduce your energyand the energy of people around you.
zVenting your feelings once or twice is a good stress managementtechnique. Being constantly critical of them has no positive outcome.
“Focus on action and not on blame”
“If it is to be, it is up to me”“Light a candle instead of cursing the darkness ”
Ultimately, you are the one responsible for yourself. You play a crucial part in
every situation in your life. What you are today is a result of your choice. This
is accountability.
Leaders involve others in decision-making
As a leader you have to make various decisions. A community leader rarelymakes a decision alone. By law, a decision, which affects the communityneeds to be taken along with the community members. The community needsto feel  ownership of decisions taken. Only then they will do their best to
achieve what they have decided.
For example, as an ASHA you have to articulate and assert yourself for your
community’s health needs. You need to decide and prioritise the health needsof the community along with community members and jointly develop a planof action. This will encourage them to join hands with you to take necessaryaction.
Leaders motivates others
To achieve the goal of the Right to Health you need the support of your

PAGE 248

36community members, the Panchayat, SHG etc. As a leader, you need to
motivate your community to join hands with you. Motivation comes through
zBeing in regular contact with them
zSharing necessary information regularly
zGiving them responsibility
zThanking them for their support
zGiving them credit for their efforts
z Appreciating them honestly in public
Leaders achieve unity
As a leader you need to promote unity among your community members andbetween the community members and health care providers. Unity can be
achieved by listening to everyone’s points of view while taking decisions. Do
not make anyone feel neglected since later they may become difficult personsto manage.
Unity comes when community members feel the ownership of the goal that
you have set as an ASHA for your village.
Leaders serve as  role models
Leaders have followers. Therefore, it is very important that all your actions
are responsible.
For example, as an ASHA you are assigned the role of accompanying a
pregnant woman for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the lifeof woman in your village, you have set an example. Next time, when the
need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a
pregnant woman during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and
transport, if required.
Leader listen and explain
Listening helps to make the process of decision-making easier and more
meaningful. Also, the as a leader you  need to articulate and explain your
point of view.
For example, at the village level families are not proactive in preparing for
the birth of a child. You need to listen to them about the reasons for theirlack of motivation. Based on their views, explain to them the need for birth
preparedness and the likely consequences of poor birth preparedness. Share
positive examples where birth preparedness has helped to save a woman’s

37Leaders represent the community
A leader is the face of the community. As an ASHA, when you discuss the
health concerns of your community with the health service provider, you arerepresenting your community. Share their points of view rather than merelyyours.
For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along
with the Panchayat and health and sanitation committee. While developing a
plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of the poor of your
community. Share their feelings and opinions, and make sure that whateverdecision is taken to develop the health plan, reflects their voices. If somesegment of the community has shared that the source of  drinking water isnot accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion whiledeveloping a comprehensive health plan for the village.
As a leader some of the skills you need to build are
zCommunication
zDecision-making
zNegotiation
zCoordination

God gave us a mouth and two ears to communicate
People failing to communicate create confusion, frustration and problems.
Communication is the exchange or two-way flow of information and ideas
between two or more persons.
Communication is the most important skill to fulfill your role as an  ASHA.
There are different forms of communication
zVerbal communication
zNon-verbal communication
zWritten communication
As an ASHA you need to use all three types of communication.
Verbal communication
This is the most common mode of communication used. Normally, we think
communication is completed once we have orally delivered the message. Butthat is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. Toknow if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/heunderstood the message and take feedback. In short, effective
communication is two-way. One-way communication is usually not effective.

39Some Tips for Effective Verbal Communication
zAccuracy
zClarity
zCorrectness
Points to take care of while communicating:
zMaintain eye contact with the person with whom you are talking.
zBe confident while communicating. Stand or sit confidently.
zStick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time.
zBe specific, sincere, honest and direct while  communicating
zShare feelings while communicating.
zBe open-minded. This will help you to understand the other person’s point
    of view.
zYour voice should be loud enough so that everyone can hear you. Your
pronunciation should be clear. Use words which are easy to understand. Do
    not use technical words or jargon.
zIf someone has something worth mentioning, give them scope to do so.Never forget to compliment/appreciate others.
The speaker is assured that you are listening when you use verbal affirmations
like, “I see,” I” agree”, “uh, okay, then….” during the conversation at
appropriate points.
Non-Verbal Communication
We all know that communication is not only about words and languages. Evensilence communicates and eyes talk. Hence, it is important to understandthese forms of communication which are referred to as non-verbalcommunication.
Here are some non-verbal behavioural aspects which require extra attention.
zEye contact : Looking at the person with whom you are talking is an
effective way of declaring that you are sincere/honest about what you aresaying and also communicates confidence.
zBody posture : The value or weight of your messages will increase if
you face the person, stand or sit appropriately close and hold your head erect.
zFacial expressions : Express appropriate feelings on your face. Effective
communication requires supporting facial expressions.
zGestures:  Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but
it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety.
zVoice characteristics : The volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should
be well modulated.

PAGE 252

40Active Listening is Communication too
All of us can hear, but all of us cannot listen. Hearing and listening are not the
same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening involves the reception andinterpretation of what is heard. It decodes the sound heard meaningfully.Does a knock on the door sound the same all the time? What if you are aloneand you hear a knock late at night? What happens if you hear a knock whenyou are expecting someone whom you like?
Active listening involves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain
information, obtain directions, understand others, solve problems, shareinterests, see how the other person feels, or even show support. This type oflistening takes the same amount of, or more, energy than speaking. Itrequires the listener to hear various messages, understand the meaning andthen verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing
what was heard.
Following are some of the tips for good listening:
zMaintain eye contact
zSit or stand in a receptive position, lean forward
zEncourage by using  positive gestures and words
zRemove distractions
zUnderstand non-verbal signals
zStop talking or doing what you were doing before you began listening
zGive time for listening
zDo not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking
zReflect on the feeling  expressed and paraphrase what has been heard
zHave patience
As an ASHA, keep the following points in mind while communicating with your
community.
zNever discriminate on the basis of caste and class while communicatingwith the community. Your tone and gesture should not change while talkingto socially and economically disadvantaged community members. Talk tothem with respect and dignity.
zA community has immense knowledge and experience. Give people achance to share and use it. Do not treat them like empty vessels.
zNever make any comment which emphasises gender inequality. Yourcommunication should be gender-sensitive.
zDo not react fast. Listen, assimilate, analyse and then react.

PAGE 253

41As an ASHA, you need to keep the following points in
mind while communicating with stakeholders
zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the
    community or from the health care system.
zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you
    prepare with the necessary information, data  and evidence. Never
    generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not
    want from them, what you want to change and what you want to    continue.
zBe calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety.
zDo not use a blaming tone.
You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will
affect those around you. And, of course, confidence and
assertiveness will help get your message through. A point to
note – think before you speak. 
Written Communication
As an ASHA you would need to write applications and letters to the authorities
to improve access to health care services. You also need to document theprocesses and decisions taken during meetings. Let us first learn how to write
simply and effectively. Read the following letter:
Dear Sir,
There are many women in villages in different areas, which is far away
from the place where the ANC clinic is organised. Especially in thesummer season, the women cannot travel long distances to the clinicand hence cannot get their ANC check-ups done. If the clinic can be
conducted in two areas on different dates all women can come there and
benefit.I request this on behalf of all the community women.
Thank you
ASHA
Village name
Do you clearly understand what the letter is about?
It is a well-intended effort to bring to the notice of the person concerned the
conditions that deprive the village women of the  ANC’s services and also

PAGE 254

42suggests solutions to overcome this problem. But since it is not clear and
specific, it does not seem to be effective.
The letter can be made more effective if it includes the following details:Before starting to write an application/letter, every writer should ask1. Do I know what I want to say the (the subject)?2. Do I know to whom I am writing?
3. Do I know why I am  writing?
Read the same letter given below and see the difference between the first
letter and the second.
To                                                                         Date
___________(Name and address)___________
___________
Sub: request to organise MAMTA Day at two locations in the villageDear CDHO (write the name of the concerned person):I am working as ASHA for the village ________ of________ Block. My village
has a population of ________ . The houses are scattered across the areas.
The ANM regularly comes and organises MAMTA Day. However, it is
organised at a place which is not accessible for all the pregnant women.
A large number of women living on the other side of the village, are notable to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance.
I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the
village on different dates. I had a discussion about the same with theANM. She informed me that she needs permission from you. I request you
to look into this matter. As an ASHA I take the responsibility to bring all
the pregnant women so they have their antenatal check-up. You arewelcome to visit our village.
Thank you.
Yours sincerely,
ASHA (write name of ASHA and the village)

PAGE 255

43There are many points to be kept in view in order to convey our messages
correctly and precisely. The principles of writing include several do’s anddon’ts
Some Do’s1. Address it to the appropriate person2. Check that the letter has a date and reference
3. Keep sentences short
4. Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones5. Do not be vague and mention the reference points for clarity6. Never assume that the reader is aware of the facts and would understand
them.
7. Review your writing to add any missing points
8. Write and re-write the letter to get the essence correctly.
9. Explain facts through evidence and examples10.The letter should flow logically from one point to another11.Write with a view to express and not to impress
Some Don’ts
1. Avoid unnecessary words
2. Avoid incomplete and irrelevant arguments
3. Do not use ambiguous sentences and universal negatives

Each decision that we make  has a consequence and a level of impact. Even a
small decision has the potential to drastically change the course of our lives.All of us can recall some such decisions taken personally or by others whichhave left an important impact. Decision-making is a learned skill and must bepracticed consciously to  strengthen it.
As an ASHA you would often require to take some decisions, which will effect
the community at large. Hence, it is very important for you to master theskill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels.
There are some basic steps of decision-making which need to be followed:
Define the Problem
Look at the situation carefully and examine it from all perspectives to find
out the actual problem.
For example, you have observed frequent occurence of malaria in the village,
affecting the basic health status of the people, especially women andchildren.  Malaria seems to be the problem and needs to be eradicated.However, the root problem is drainage water coming out of every housecollecting near  residential areas and schools.
 Decision-Making
Skills

PAGE 257

45To eradicate malaria completely you need to
mobilise people and think of solutions to
control the drainage problem.
Gather Information
Once the problem is identified, collect all the necessary information, seek
advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Use allavailable resources in a way to amicably solve this issue.
Think of Alternatives
At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meetingand discuss the situation with people with whom you have worked with to
collect information regarding the problem. You may also present this in the
Gram Sabha. What is important is that people accept and understand theproblem. Later, alternative solutions may be suggested.
In participatory decision-making, it is very important that the community
owns the problem and feels responsible towards solving it.
Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a
permanent basis.
Choose an Alternative
Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative
from the various options available. This can be done through consensus of thecommunity and approval, of the authorities. To gain consensus and approvalyou would need to discuss it in the village meetings, the Gram Sabha,Panchayat meetings etc.
Before selecting the right alternative, assess all available options. It is
important to be practical in taking a decision.
Put the Decisions to Work
An effective decision is one which can be put into action. Thus,implementation is very important. During this process, keep checking if it ismoving towards the expected solution, and if there is something else whichneeds to be addressed.
Nobody is an expert in every skill.They can be mastered only through
practice. Hence, decision-making skills can also be sharpened throughexperience and practice.
But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the
decision fails. This is part of the learning process. Accepting responsibility foryour actions is a very important quality and a sign of maturity.

PAGE 258

46How to Handle Difficult Situations
If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then
continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue andreview the options. It is also may be a good idea to adjourn and let peoplethink about it overnight.
Description of an Effective Decision
zAn effective decision should not leave any unhappy feelingamong group members after the meeting has beenadjourned.
zAn effective decision can be translated into reality. It shouldnot be decision impossible to put in action.
zAn effective decision can be lived with. It does not set up
    conflict of a debilitating nature among persons or groups.
zAn effective decision must involve the group enough for the
    members to implement the decision.

Although everyone negotiates informally all the time without even being
aware of it, formal negotiation is a skill that can be learned throughexperience and practice. People who negotiate a lot tend to be much moreskilled at it than people who have not participated in any formalnegotiation. Negotiation means dealing with differences between two or
more individuals or groups. As an ASHA you will have to deal with differences.
You have  to resolve these differences to achieve the larger goals of villagehealth programmes. Let us build an understanding of the process ofnegotiation.
Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different
needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue.
Because negotiating is an inter-personal process, each negotiating situation is
different, and is influenced by each party’s skills, attitudes and style. Weoften look at negotiating as unpleasant because it implies conflict, butnegotiating need not be characterised by bad feelings or angry behavior.Understanding more about the negotiation process allows us to manage ournegotiations with confidence and increases the chance that the outcomes will
be positive for both parties.
Negotiations need not be confrontational by being offensive, insulting and
challenging. In fact, effective negotiation is characterised by  groups workingtogether to find a solution, rather than each group trying to WIN at any cost.Negotiation
Skills

PAGE 260

48Keep in mind that the attitude that you take in a negotiation (e.g, hostile or
cooperative) will set the tone for the interaction. If you are confrontational,you will have a fight on your hands.
Negotiating is a complex process but definitely one worth mastering. If you
keep in mind that you are responsible for the success or failure of the
negotiation, and if you follow the tips given here, you will find the process
easier.
We need to understand that in a successful negotiation everyone wins. The
objective should be agreement, not victory or to make the other party orperson feel low.
As an ASHA you will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in
order to be able to fulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is
quite a challenge to negotiate with people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of  situationwhich requires negotiation.
Let us Understand the steps of Successful Negotiation
Ask for the other person’s perspective
In a negotiating situation use questions to find out what the other person’s
concerns and needs might be. Some examples of likely questions are: What do
you need from me on this? What are your concerns about what I amsuggesting/asking? When you hear the other person express their needs orconcerns, use appropriate listening responses to make sure you heardcorrectly.
State Your needs
In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs.
It is very important to state not only what you need but also why you need it.
Prepare options beforehandBefore entering into a negotiating session, prepare some options that you can
suggest if your preferred solution is not acceptable. Anticipate why the other
person may resist your suggestion and be prepared to counter the same with
an alternative.
Do not argueNegotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about trying to prove the
other person wrong. We know that during negotiation each party tries toprove the other one wrong, no progress is made. Do not waste time in
arguing. If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle,
but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a powerstruggle.

PAGE 261

49Consider timing
There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those
situations where there is a high degree of anger on either side, apreoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or tiredness on oneside or the other. The best outcome for almost all negotiations is a win/win
situation when both parties walk away with a positive feeling about having
achieved their goals.
Suggestions for Effective Negotiation
While negotiating as an ASHA you must have unlimited patience. Never try tomake the opponent feel low and defeated. Emphathise with the other personto understand her/his perspective.
Be positive and open in your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any
set assumptions or negative feelings. Approach a negotiation with an attitude
of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right tohave an opinion of your own.”You may think that this is being soft and noteffective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence.

Coordination
Skills
As an ASHA you are a link between health care services and the community.
Therefore, you are expected to regularly coordinate with various stakeholders
and  the community.

PAGE 263

51You need to be aware of different ways of coordination and how to ensure
effective coordination. With effective coordination you will be able to improvethe health status of your community.
You need to coordinate with the health facilities to
zlearn about decisions taken at the PHC or at the Integrated Child
Development officers’ level
zshare your concerns regarding the access to health care and nutrition
services at the village level
zjointly plan health activities to get optimum outcome
zplan health camp at the village level and organise MAMTA Day
zset up mechanisms to ensure timely referrals for pregnant women
There are different ways of coordination. The most common way of
coordination is to meet the concerned person regularly and discuss the issueor share information. Another way of coordination is to call a meeting. Youmay need special skills for effective coordination. Let us understand them.
Each meeting needs to be productive. A productive meeting is well-planned
and result-oriented. Unproductive meetings are too long, vague in purpose,
poorly controlled and frustrating.
zDecide the agenda of the meeting. Decide who should be called. Invite only
those people who can contribute to the meeting and take follow-upactions.
zShare the agenda with the concerned persons. This is very critical. At the
village level there may be no need to send a written agenda, However you
need to clearly orally inform them about the purpose of the meeting andthe points, which need to be discussed.
zAt the beginning of the meeting, welcome all the participants. Make acircular sitting arrangement to enable an enriching conversation/dialogue.
zExplain the purpose of the meeting again and make sure that they all have
a common understanding. Jointly fix how much time you need to spend on
the meeting.
zGive time to each person to share their views. Avoid simultaneousdiscussions.
zIf decisions need to be taken, discuss them and articulate the outcome.
zIf actions need to be taken after the meeting, list down the actions along
with who is responsible for the action, who will support it and a time-line
for completion of the action.
zAt the end of the meeting prepare a brief report. The report needs tohave following information:

This report needs to be appropriately filed and should be referred to during
the next meeting, to review the progress.
Some tips to play your role as an effective coordinator of
a village meeting
zAs an ASHA you have to prepare adequately before meeting. Personally
meet the participants beforehand and inform them about the agenda of
the meeting. Have clarity on what you are going to discuss. You should also
be well aware about the complexity of the issue.
zYou should be able to judge what will be the reaction of the otherperson when you discuss the issue with her or him. Be prepared with thecounter-arguments.
zWhile having the discussion listen and observe carefully. Any change in a
person’s expression communicate a lot.

PAGE 265

53zDuring the discussion, if you need to take some on-the-spot decision, be
prepared for it.
zAt the end of the discussion, briefly articulate the decision taken or theactions enlisted.
zWithin a few days after the discussion. Ensure that the decisions are putinto action.
zIt is very important that each meeting is documented. You may use thegiven format to document your meetings.
zIn the process of coordination, each member plays an important role.As an ASHA you need to make sure that you are in touch with all theconcerned stakeholders and keep them  informed of the progress.
zNever hesitate to take help of others while facilitating a meeting. If youneed help, identify the person well in advance and brief her/him whatkind of help you need. You should to have full confidence in the person you
select.
A person needs to be confident and have good
self-esteem so as to effectively articulate her/his
thoughts.

ASHA Module 6
Simple Skills that Save Lives
4About this book
The sixth and seventh modules cover areas whose content is already 
familiar to the ASHA. In addition, this module includes the development of speciﬁ  c competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, 
intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.  
Acknowledgements

1. Role of ASHA
ASHA is considered to be a healthcare facilitator and provider of a limited 
range of healthcare services. Health rights would be integral to her work and would be focused in the areas of community mobilisation to improve health status, access to services, and promote people’s participation in health programmes. 
PART A
Didi, which day is the ANM 
coming to our village?
Didi, they are charging me at the govt 
hospital and I don’t have the money to 
pay – can you help me?This is the first day of diarrhoea. Do 
I have go to the far away town or is 
there something you can suggest?Objectives of this Session
By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about:• The role of an ASHA and the activities expected of her.
• The health outcomes that her work should result in.• The sets of skills that she needs to be eﬀ  ective in.
• The records that she has to maintain.
• The arrangements for her support and supervision.

ASHA Module 6
Simple Skills that Save Lives
82. Activities of an ASHA 
ASHA’s work consists mainly of ﬁ  ve activities:
1. Home Visits: For two to three hours every day, for at 
least four or ﬁ  ve days a week, the ASHA should visit the 
families living in her allo/g308  ed area. Home visits should 
take place at least once in a month if not more. Home 
visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive 
care. Over time, families will come to her when there is 
a problem and she would not have to go so o/g286  en to their 
houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/
village is enough. However, where there is a child 
below two years of age or any malnourished child or a 
pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home 
for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the 
house, a series of ﬁ  ve visits or more becomes essential.  
2. A/g308  ending the Village Health and Nutrition Day 
(VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide immunisation and other services in the village, ASHA will promote a/g308  endance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM services and helps with service delivery. 
3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually 
accompanying a pregnant woman or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort. The visit could also be to a/g308  end a training programme or review meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit, in others, there would be more.
4. Holding village level meeting  of women’s groups, and 
the Village Health and Sanitation Commi/g308  ee (VHSC), 
for increasing health awareness and to plan health work.
5. Maintain records which would make her more 
organised and make her work easier, and help her to plan be/g308  er for the health of the people.
The ﬁ  rst three relate to facilitation or provision of healthcare 
and the last two are supportive and mobilisational activities.

Being an ASHA
 93. Measurable Outcomes of the ASHA Programme
In the course of conducting these ﬁ  ve activities, the ASHA should ensure the 
following: 
Maternal Health 
1. That every pregnant woman and her family receive health information for 
promotion of appropriate healthcare practices – diet, rest and for increased use of services which would focus on care in pregnancy, delivery, postnatal care and family planning services. 
2. That every pregnant woman avails of antenatal care and postnatal care at the 
monthly health worker clinic/VHND.
3. That every family with a pregnant woman has made a plan and is prepared for 
the event of childbirth. 
4. That every couple that needs contraceptive services is counselled on where to 
avail of the service. 
Newborn and Child Health 
1. That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286  en if there are 
problems and receives essential home-based care as well as appropriate referral for the sick newborn.
2. That every family receives the information and support it needs to access 
immunisation.
3. That all families with children below the age of two years are counselled and 
supported for – prevention and management of malnutrition and anaemia and for prevention of illness such as malaria, recurrent diarrhoea and respiratory infection. 
4. That every child below ﬁ  ve years with diarrhoea, fever, Acute Respiratory 
Infection (ARI) and worms, brought to her a/g308  ention is counselled on whether referral is immediately required or whether, given the problems of access to a doctor, ﬁ  rst contact curative care with home remedies and drugs in her kit, the child can be managed.
Disease Control
1. That those individuals noticed during home visits as having chronic cough or 
blindness or a skin patch in a high leprosy block are referred to the appropriate centre for further check-up. 
2. That those prescribed a long course of drugs for tuberculosis or leprosy or surgery 
for cataract are followed up and encouraged to take the drugs or go for surgery.
3. That those with fever which could be malaria (or kala – azar) have their blood 
tested to detect the disease and provide appropriate care/referral.
4. That the village and health authorities are alerted to any outbreak of disease she 
notes during her visits. 
Note: Each outcome is not a separate activity. They are part of the protocol 
followed during a single activity _ the home visit.

Simple Skills that Save Lives
104. Essential Skills for an ASHA
The essential skills that an ASHA requires can be classiﬁ  ed into six sets. 
These are simple skills requiring only a few hours to learn, but they can save thousands of lives. These six sets of skills are given below:
1. Maternal Care
a. Counselling of pregnant 
women
b. Ensuring complete antenatal 
care through home visits and 
enabling care at VHND

 136. Conducting a Home Visit  
The purpose of the home visit is to interact 
with the family, especially the young women of the house, so as to develop a rapport with them, communicate key health messages, support them for be/g308  er 
healthcare practices, identify illness early and provide appropriate advice. 
In particular, homes with a pregnant woman, or a woman who had an 
abortion or delivery within the last one month, or with any child below two or any malnourished child needs regular home visits. 
The ﬁ  rst step is to gather information to understand the situation. You should 
ask appropriate initial questions, listen to the woman’s response actively, 
and do not interrupt the woman while she is speaking. Once the mother has ﬁ  nished, ask further questions to clarify what she has said. Then seek 
more information by asking more detailed and probing questions about the duration of illness and the symptoms.
The second step a/g286  er listening is to ﬁ  rst praise the mother for how she 
is managing and reinforce the correct actions she is taking. Then make suggestions to the mother/woman on what further she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information. Repeat the key information to make sure that the mother has understood it. You should ask whether the 
All Visits
(Basic communication skills to create friendly environment)
• Greeting.
• Explain why she is visiting today.
• Act in a way so family feels they can confide in her.
• Speak in a gentle tone.
• Use simple words in local language.
• Be respectful.
• Praise what the woman is doing correctly and build up her self-confidence.
• Point out why you are discouraging some health practices; do not merely 
condemn it or brand it as bad, superstition etc. 
• Ask, don’t tell. 
• Check if the woman has any questions.
• Answer in simple language.
• Thank the woman after the visit and inform the family when you (ASHA) will 
return.

14suggestion is applicable and acceptable, and whether she would be able to 
implement it. If necessary, ask the woman to repeat what has been suggested. Discuss further and come to an understanding of what can be done 
Then the third step,  you should discuss and try to correct any 
misconceptions or rumours. Finally, you should also arrange for follow-up visit or referral. Do NOT “prescribe” health advice: You need to “counsel.” See the examples 
below: 
Gratuitous Ineffective Messages Useful Health Communication Message
To prevent diarrhoea, pay attention 
to cleanliness. To prevent diarrhoea, please ensure that you wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food or feeding the child and after cleaning up after defecation.
Take good care of the child. Are you able to find enough time to feed the 
child? To play with the child? Who looks after the child when you are at work?
Your child is now one year old. You must give it nutritious food. Would it be possible for you to give your child an egg daily (or milk, green vegetables etc)? How would you manage it? Can you afford it? Would other children in the family also demand it, and would that create a problem?
Difficult Situations
If the woman is shy
• Speak of general things to ‘warm her up’.
• Encourage the woman to speak.
• Praise the woman more to make her confident.
• Repeat the questions.
If the woman is non-cooperative or argumentative 
• Praise the women to make her feel secure.
• Sympathise with her and be friendly; do not get angry.
• Spend more time in listening to her. 
• Do not push if the woman is still not immediately receptive but just say that 
you would like to come again. 
If the woman is curious and asks many questions
• Answer her questions in simple language.
• Explain that you will be coming every month so they can talk again.

 157. Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) 
VHND is a common platform for allowing the people to access the services of 
the ANM and the male health worker and of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC). It is held at the AWC once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the children, provides antenatal care to pregnant women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. In addition, the ANM provides a basic level of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. 
The VHND is an occasion for health communication on a number of key 
health issues. It should be a/g308  ended by the members of the PRI, particularly the women members, pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. The VHND is to be seen as a major mobilisation event to reinforce health messages. You should provide information on the topics given below during the VHND. These topics can be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. 
Topics for Health Communication during the VHND 
• Care in pregnancy, including nutrition, importance of antenatal care and 
danger sign recognition. 
• Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care.
• Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate 
complementary feeding.
• Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and discussion 
on what actions can be taken locally to improve the situation. 
• Delaying the age at marriage, postponing the ﬁ  rst pregnancy and the need 
for spacing.
• Adolescent health awareness, including nutrition, retention in school till 
high/higher secondary level, anaemia correction, menstrual hygiene and 
responsible sexual behaviour. 
• Prevention of Malaria, TB and other 
communicable diseases.
• Awareness on prevention and seeking care 
for RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS.
• Prevention of tobacco use and alcoholism.
What should you do for a successful 
VHND?
• Make a list of the following and ensure 
their presence during the VHND meeting:
/rhombus6  Pregnant women for their antenatal or 
postnatal care.

189. ASHA Support and Supervision 
• For ASHA to be eﬀ  ective and for her skills to be 
updated, she needs both on-the-job support and 
refresher trainings. 
• Each ASHA will be supported in the ﬁ  eld by an 
ASHA facilitator.
• The ASHA facilitator will interact with ASHA at 
least twice if not thrice a month. 
• At least one of these interactions will be in the 
form of a “mentoring” visit to the hamlet where she provides her services. This would focus on mentoring or on-the-job training. 
• Another one or two interactions would be in a local review meeting. This 
could be held at Gram Panchayat (GP) level, or at the sector level or even at the block level. 
• Each of the facilitators will have a clear protocol of activities to follow 
for the mentoring visit to the ASHAs and for the review meetings. The purpose of these interactions are:
a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and 
information on what work ASHA is doing.
b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems 
they encounter.
c For providing training and refresh or update their knowledge and 
skills.
d For helping ASHAs plan their work.e For building up mutual solidarity and motivation.f For troubleshooting problems, especially as regards payments and 
addressing grievances. 
g For reﬁ  lls to their drug kit
• The Medical Oﬃ   cer In-charge of the block PHC/CHC should a/g308  end at 
least one monthly meeting of all ASHAs in the Primary Health Centre 
(PHC) area, to review work progress.

1. Pregnancy Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as possible a/g286  er the ﬁ  rst missed period. 
There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early:
• Missed Periods
• Pregnancy testing: through use of the Nischay home pregnancy test card 
/rhombus6 The Nischay test card can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. 
/rhombus6 The test can be done immediately a/g286  er the missed period. 
/rhombus6 A positive test means that the woman is pregnant. 
/rhombus6 The beneﬁ  t of early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be 
registered early by the ANM and start ge/g308  ing antenatal care soon. 
/rhombus6 A negative test means that the woman is not pregnant. In case she is not 
pregnant and does not want to get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt 
a family planning method.
/rhombus6 The result of the test should be kept conﬁ  dential.
Instructions for the use of the Nishcay Kit are in Annexe 2.
PART B
 1 All knowledge areas in this chapter have been covered in ASHA Module 2.
Objectives of this session
By the end of the session the ASHA will learn about:

• Determining Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up
1. 
• Identiﬁ  cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral.
• Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up with pregnant women. • Knowledge of safe delivery. • Understand obstetric emergencies and enable appropriate referral for emergencies.• Updating Maternal Health Cards with support from the ANM.

22 Determining LMP and EDD
When pregnancy is diagnosed, you should help the pregnant woman in 
calculating the probable date when she is likely to deliver. 
Steps to ﬁ  nd the EDD• Find out from the woman the date of the ﬁ  rst day of her LMP .• Then count nine months a/g286  er that date.• Add seven days to that date.For example, If the ﬁ  rst day of the LMP is:  10th Dec. 2009
Nine months later is: 10th Sept. 2010
Adding seven days is: 17th Sept. 2010
Therefore, the expected date of delivery is  17th September 2010
Note: This method only gives an approximate date of delivery, and baby may be 
born anytime during 15 days before or after the EDD. 
This picture drawn beside helps you in estimating the date of delivery.1

23 Maternal HealthPart BFacts about Antenatal Check-up
How many antenatal check-ups?
Four antenatal visits must be ensured, including registration within the first 
three month period. The suggested schedule is as below:
1st visit:  Within 12 weeks—preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected—
for registration of pregnancy and first antenatal check-up
2nd visit:  Between 14 and 26 weeks
3rd visit:  Between 28 and 34 
weeks 
4th visit: After 36 weeks
It is advisable for the pregnant woman to visit the Medical Officer (MO) at the PHC for the third antenatal visit, as well as availing of the required investigations at the PHC.
• Early registration
• Regular weight check
• Blood test for anaemia 
• Urine test for protein and sugar
• Measure blood pressure
• One tablet of IFA every day 
for three months to prevent anaemia 
• Treatment for anaemia 
• Two doses of Tetanus Toxoid 
(TT) vaccine 
• Nutrition counselling
• Preparing for birth.

24Where are ANC services provided? 
The nearest place for ANC services for a woman is at the AWC during the monthly VHND. The pregnant w oman could also go to the Sub-Centre, 
where the 
ANM will provide ANC services. ANC services are also provided 
at the PHC or Community Health Centre (CHC) or district hospital.  
Identification of problems and danger signs
Given below are complications that can occur during the antenatal period for which pregnant w omen must seek treatment in an institution:
• 
Jaundice, high blood pressure, fever with chills, or bleeding
• Severe anaemia
• Women with protein and sugar in their urine• Swelling of feet, face and hands.Given below are danger signs for which pregnant women must seek delivery 
in a centre where they can manage complications including those requiring surgery and blood transfusion.
• Mothers who had a complication in a previous pregnancy 
(C section, prolonged labour, stillborn, neonatal death)
• Pregnant women with severe anaemia.• Pregnant women having any of the danger signs of the antenatal period 
which are still persisting at the time of delivery.
Some women are to be considered more at risk of developing complications 
during delivery and therefore, must opt for an institutional delivery. These include: 
• Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough weight.
Key tasks to be undertaken during ANC
• List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest 
families, and in any sections which tend to get le/g286   out, e.g. women from 
SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main village, or in hamlets that fall between villages and newly migrant women. 
• Educate pregnant women about care in pregnancy, especially on the 
importance of increased nutrition, rest, and complete ANC services.

PAGE 295

25 Maternal HealthPart B• Emphasise the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet during 
pregnancy. The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of 
cereals, pulses (including beans and nuts), vegetables including greens, milk, eggs, meat and ﬁ  sh. If possible, the family should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. Meat and nuts are especially good for anaemic women. You should explain to the mother and family that no foods should be forbidden during pregnancy. 
• See when ANC is due for each check-up and remind them appropriately.
• Escort pregnant woman to VHND where they are hesitant or need such 
support.
• Ensure that all components of ANC are delivered.• Ensure that the Maternal Card is updated.
Planning for a Safe Delivery
You should
• Know how to calculate the EDD and communicate this to the pregnant woman.
• Know which institutions in the area provide different levels of care and establish linkages with 
providers there. 
• At least once before delivery, take the pregnant woman to this centre and introduce her to the 
providers.
• Know what transport is available _ whether funded by the state or other private means _ that is easily 
accessible and affordable and how to call on it when the need arises.
• Assist all pregnant women and families to prepare plans for birth: including identifying funding 
sources should money be required at short notice. Sometimes Self-Help Groups (SHGs) may advance 
money in emergency even if the woman is not a member. This is most important for women in remote hamlets, or in communities which are currently not availing of institutional delivery or those at high risk for complications. 
• Know what records (BPL card) need to be carried to the institution.
• Share birth plans with ANM and PHC MO at the VHND or monthly meeting.
• Identify mothers with complications, or a high likelihood of developing complications with support 
from the ANM. Inform them of the institutions that it is most advisable for them to go to and motivate the mother and the family to go there and escort them if required.

262. Birth Preparedness for a Safe Delivery
What is Birth Preparedness? 
This is a method of planning in advance by the pregnant mother and her family for a safe and comfortable deliv ery 
and for care a/g286  
er delivery. You should help every family 
make this plan in consultation with the ANM.
What are the choices available to the mother? 
1. If there are any danger signs or complications:  
Identify the nearest institution (CHC/District Hospital) which has the staﬀ   and equipment to provide 
Comprehensiv
e Emergency Obstetric and Newborn 
Care (CEmONC), and counsel the mother and the family to go there. 
2. If there are no complications: Counsel the mother to go to the PHC which is 
open 24 X 7, where there is a team of doctors and nurses or ANMs to conduct the delivery and provide care for the mother and newborn. These institutions can manage some complications and transfer immediately to a higher facility if complications requiring surgery or blood transfusion develop. The list of such institutions can be obtained from the ANM. The place should be clean and safe and friendly and have a skilled nurse or doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a/g286  er delivery. 
3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or 
unable to go to the 24x7 PHC or if it is too far away:  Advise the mother 
could go the Sub-Centre, provided it is accredited as a delivery centre, which means the ANM has been trained as a Skilled Birth A/g308  endant (SBA), 
and is available, and there are minimum facilities for delivery.
4. If there are no complications or not a high risk case for developing 
complications and the mother and family insist on delivering at home, despite counselling: You could work with the ANM to enable a delivery 
by SBA. This should be agreed to only if you are sure that the family can organise transport and funds at very short notice. The SBA should be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the onset of labour at the home/Sub-Centre and should able to stay through the process of labour and for a few hours a/g286  erwards. A team of two or three women with experience in a/g308  ending at 
labour would be helpful.
What does a birth preparedness plan contain? (See Annexe-3 for format for individual plan)
When should a birth preparedness plan be readied? It should be ready as early as possible a/g286  er conﬁ 
rming the pregnancy, and 
in consultation with the family (husband, mother-in-law, or other decision 
makers). You should review the plan in the third trimester (a/g286  er seventh 
month) with the family and the ANM. At this time, the choice of institution and the transport should be ﬁ  nalised.

PAGE 297

27 Maternal HealthPart BDecisions People Make
 Where should I go 
for a safe delivery?
Birth Micro Plan of ASHA/ANM/AWW
I help every family with a pregnant 
woman to make a birth plan. If she has any danger signs or complications, I will ask her to go to the CHC or DH when her delivery is due.I must also make arrangements to ensure that the transport is ready and available at that time. 
But if she and her family do not want to go that far and the 24X7 PHC is crowded, I will advise her to go to the nearby sub-centre where two ANMs are trained to conduct deliveries and one of them is always there.
For some women, family circumstances and beliefs 
make even going to the sub-centre diffi  cult. I will then get the ANM to come to her house, and will assist in the preparations needed, after counselling that a safe delivery in this situation may not always be possible. 
If I go to the PHC which is open 24 hours, I will be cared for and can rest for two days. Also, if there is any surgery needed, they can rush me to the big hospital quickly.
Woman’s choice
I will also need to ensure that I have an escort, maybe the ASHA, to accompany me, and that someone is taking care of the children and things at home. If danger signs or complications develop before the delivery, I will need to go to the big hospital straight away, but I hope that does not happen.
If she has no complications, I will counsel her to go to the 24X7 PHC, and for this too, I must ensure that transport arrangements are made in time.

283. Management of Anaemia
In India, anaemia among women is very common. The chances of a mother 
having a delivery before term, or even dying are higher among mothers with severe anaemia. In order to make sure that all women have good iron stores, all pregnant women should be given iron tablets, even if they are not anaemic. Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test, which measures the amount of a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb). Low levels of Hb mean that the woman has anaemia (see box below). The test should be performed during the antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. 
Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia
More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal
7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia
Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia
If a woman during the time of pregnancy has Hb level below 11g/dl, she is considered to be suﬀ  ering from anaemia. 
Common symptoms of severe anaemia include:• Very pale tongue• Weakness• General swelling in body. 
For women who do not have anaemia (Hb more than 11 g/dl)
The pregnant woman should take one tablet of IFA every day for at least 100 
days (prophylactic dose), starting a/g286  er the ﬁ  rst trimester, at least 14-16 weeks 
of gestation to prevent anaemia. This dosage regimen is to be repeated again for three months a/g286  er the delivery.
If a woman is found to be anaemic:
• The woman should be given two IFA tablets per day for three months. 
This means that a pregnant w oman with anaemia needs to take at least 
200 tablets of IF
A. Besides taking IFA tablets, you should encourage the 
pregnant woman, where possible, to increase her dietary intake of iron-rich food.
• The Hb level should be estimated again a/g286  er one month. If the level 
increases, you should tell the woman to continue with two tablets of IFA daily until the Hb comes to normal. If the Hb does not rise in spite of taking IFA tablets, in the prescribed dose, you should refer the woman to the nearest facility that is equipped to manage complications in pregnancy.
• You should refer women with severe anaemia immediately to the nearest 
PHC/CHC/DH for further treatment. Such women may need injections or blood transfusions.

PAGE 299

29 Maternal HealthPart B• The dosage regimen of two IFA tablets per 
day should be repeated for three months 
post-partum also. 
Counselling pregnant women on anaemia:
•  Encourage women to take iron-rich foods 
such as green leafy vegetables, whole 
pulses, ragi, jaggery, meat and liver. This advice should be discussed with family and ﬁ  nalised based on the family situation. 
•  Encourage the woman, where possible, 
to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption of iron.
•  Counsel the women on the necessity of taking IFA, the dangers associated 
with anaemia, and inform the women that these side-eﬀ  ects are common and not serious, and will reduce over time.
•  IFA tablets must be taken regularly, preferably early in the morning on an 
empty stomach. If the woman has nausea and pain in abdomen, she may take the tablets a/g286  er meals or at night. This will avoid nausea.
• Dispel the myths and misconceptions related to IFA and convince the 
woman about the importance of taking it. An example of a common myth is that the consumption of IFA may aﬀ  ect baby’s complexion.
• Many women do not take IFA tablets regularly due to some common 
side-eﬀ  ects such as nausea, constipation and black stools. Tell women not to worry about passing black stool while consuming IFA. It is normal. 
• In case of constipation, the woman should drink more water and add 
roughage (plenty of green leafy vegetables) to her diet.
• IFA tablets should not be consumed with tea, coﬀ  ee, milk or calcium tablet 
as it reduces the absorption of iron.
• IFA tablets may make the woman feel less tired than before. However, 
despite feeling be/g308  er, she should not stop taking the tablets and must complete the course as advised by the healthcare provider.
• Ask the woman to return to you if she has problem taking IFA tablets. 
How do you get the IFA?The IFA tablets are part of your drug kit. Try to ensure that you always have 
enough stock. Either your facilitator or a person appointed by the MO of the PHC is given the responsibility of reﬁ  lls for the drug kit. IFA tablets are also made available at VHND or in any health facility.

304. Identifying complications during Pregnancy and Delivery
Danger signs can occur at any time during pregnancy or delivery. You should 
be alert to these signs. A woman who experiences any one of these signs may be in serious danger and you should immediately facilitate referral to a health facility. You should also educate family members on how to recognise these complications and be prepared for immediate referral.

• Bleeding (fresh blood)
• Swollen face and hands 
• Baby lying sideways
• Water breaks but labour does not start within 24 hours or less 
• Colour of water - green or brown 
• Prolonged labour - woman pushing for more than 12 hours (eight hours in the 
case of women who have already had children) with the baby not coming out
• Fever
• Fits 
• Retained placenta

34Objectives of the Session
By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • A/g308  end and observe delivery and record various events.
• Record the time of birth in Hours, Minutes and Seconds, using a digital 
wrist watch.
• Record pregnancy outcomes as abortion, live birth, still birth or 
newborn death.
Notice that the mouth of the 
uterus is tightly closed. Head of the baby is towards mouth of uterus and baby’s umbilical cord is attached to placenta which is attached to uterus.
(a) (b)Pregnancy and the Birth Processes
Pregnant Woman Full-TermKey tasks to be undertaken:
• Know what are the important tasks in taking care of the newborn.
• Be able to carry out these tasks if required.• Ensure that SBA does not apply fundal pressure or gives injections to 
speed up labour. 
• Put baby to breast as soon as possible a/g286  er birth (provided mother is 
comfortable).
• If the delivery is taking place at home, in case of complications, mother 
and baby should be referred to the nearest health facility. 5. Care during Delivery
Observation of the delivery process was 
not part of previous ASHA training modules. In this module, you will be oriented to normal delivery processes and newborn care, and also develop the skills for recording the various events and pregnancy outcome. Even though you are not required to manage delivery, you may have to help if the delivery starts during transport. This knowledge also gives you conﬁ dence to know more about this. 
You should try and stay with the pregnant woman through delivery in the institution or at home, and post-partum period. You could therefore also be a ‘Birth Companion’ to the mother during the stay at the institution. This is not a compulsion, but a desirable service. Alternatively, a close relative could also be the birth companion.

PAGE 305

35 Maternal HealthPart BBefore Delivery
The delivery room should be 
cleaned before the delivery. If the delivery is happening at home, you should facilitate a clean delivery space. 
Immediately after birth, if the 
baby remains naked, it may become cold. Hence, baby clothes should be kept ready before delivery. 
1st Stage of labour
Starts from the beginning of pain until the mouth of the womb is fully open. This happens inside and cannot be seen. The bag of water also breaks at the end of this stage. The fluid is usually clear but may be yellow or green or red. If green, it indicates infection.
This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours in the first pregnancy. 
May take much less time in subsequent pregnancies.
Illustration (a) - drawing of side view of a pregnant woman.
In illustration (b) - the mouth of the womb is almost closed, and thick.In illustration (c) - the mouth is thinner and is opening little.In (d) - the mouth of the womb is fully open. When the womb is completely 
open, it is the end of the first stage of labour. At this time, the water bag usually breaks. This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours. It takes longer if the woman is having her first baby. (a) (b) (c) (d)

36The Process of Delivery
In this process, ASHA can see on the outside when the baby starts to move 
through the vagina in the process of being born. During each contraction, a li/g308  le more of the head is seen (a, b, c).2nd Stage of labour
Contractions push the baby out of the womb: the delivery of the baby.
This second stage of labour usually lasts about one hour. 
During the second stage of labour, the baby moves down the birth canal until the 
baby’s head is showing at the opening of the vagina. After the head is delivered, the shoulders come out and then the rest of the body.  (a) (b) (c)
3rd Stage of labour
The contractions cause the placenta to separate out from the uterus and be pushed out. delivery of the placenta. 
The third stage of labour usually takes only a few minutes. if 
it takes above 20 to 30 minutes there is  cause for concern.
(a) (b)(c)
(d) (e) (f)d

PAGE 307

37 Maternal HealthPart BThe placenta usually comes out a/g286  er 15-20 minutes. 
Points for you to pay attention to if you are also present at the time of delivery in 
the institution:
• It is not necessary to shave the area, or give an enema to the mother at the 
time of delivery.
• All deliveries do not require an episiotomy (cut at the perineal site).
• Fundal pressure (pushing on the abdomen) should not be applied.
• You should be alert if injections are being given to hasten the delivery 
process. Such injections can cause a baby who is still born, birth of a baby who is unable to breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should give the injection. 
• When the mother and baby stay in the hospital and if you are staying with 
them as a birth companion, she should ensure that the mother and baby are seen by the MO and nurse at least twice a day and whenever required if there are problems. The very top of the head comes ﬁ  rst, then the eyes, nose and mouth (d). While 
in most babies, the eyes are facing the ﬂ  oor; sometimes they are born looking 
towards the ceiling. When the baby’s head is out, it turns to one side (e) and the shoulders and rest of the body are delivered (f). Once out, the baby will cry. 
Delivery of Placenta 
The cord will be connected to the placenta which is still inside the womb.

386. Post-Partum Care 
Post-partum care is the period a/g286  er delivery of the placenta up to six weeks 
a/g286 er birth.3 
 3  Post-partum care has been covered in ASHA Module 2.Tasks for you to undertake during this period
• Conducting home visits to mother and child: Mothers and newborns 
need care from the time of birth to six weeks a/g286  er the delivery. The recommendation for postnatal care is to visit on the 3rd day a/g286  er delivery, on the 7th day and at the end of six weeks, i.e on the 42nd day. For the newborn, the recommendation is to visit on the 3rd day, 7th day, 14th day, 21st day and 28th day. A/g286  er this period, visits are still needed once in two weeks till the child is two years old for nutrition advice, immunisation advice, and support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, for illness prevention and just to remain in touch. 
• In eﬀ  ect therefore, you would need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day, 
21st, and 28th day, and a/g286  er that, once every two weeks starting from the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is born at home, then of course you should be there at birth or at least visit her within the ﬁ  rst hour. 
• Advice to the mother during these visits: 
/rhombus6 Assess the mother for signs of complications (see below for the 
list of complications) and ensure appropriate referral.
/rhombus6 Encourage her to rest for at least six weeks a/g286  er childbirth. 
Families should be counselled to allow this. 
/rhombus6 Encourage her to eat more food than usual. She can eat any kind 
of food but high protein foods – pulses and legumes (nuts are especially useful), foods of animal source. She should also drink plenty of ﬂ  uids. 
Objectives of the session
By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• Schedule of visits and tasks to be performed at each visit.• Understand the possible complications of the post-partum period.• Be able to identify the complications and refer appropriately.

PAGE 309

39 Maternal HealthPart B/rhombus6 Encourage and support for exclusive breastfeeding (Please see section 
on Breastfeeding-Part C, Section 3)
/rhombus6 Discuss with the mother the need for contraceptive services. 
Caution her on the risk of unprotected sex and the high 
chances of conceiving again. You should counsel her on the importance of spacing the next child birth for her own health and that of the baby. You should help her in making the choice of the method of family planning, whether spacing or limiting. 
Complications during the post-partum period
Some women can develop complications a/g286  er 
the childbirth. The symptoms of these major complications are:
1. Excessive bleeding: Ask the mother if the 
bleeding is heavy. O/g286  en this is quite obvious, 
but sometimes it may be diﬃ   cult to judge. 
If the woman is using more than ﬁ  ve pads 
a day or more than one thick cloth in a day, she is having heavy bleeding. You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications. You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding. Referral is most urgent. Even the delay of a few minutes can make a diﬀ  erence. 
2. Puerperal Sepsis (Infections): Ask if the discharge is foul smelling. If the 
answer is yes, then suspect infection. Fever, chills and pain in abdomen along with the foul smell make infections even more likely. You should measure temperature to conﬁ  rm fever. Referral is required since the mother needs antibiotics. Referral on the same day is advisable. 
3. Convulsions with or without swelling of face and hands, severe 
headache, and blurred vision:  Such patients need immediate referral. If 
ANM is available within 15 minutes, she can stabilise the patient before referral.
4. Anaemia: You should check if the mother is pale and enable the mother to 
get her blood Hb status checked (for management of anaemia in the post-partum period, please see Section 3).
5. Breast engorgement and Infection:  (Part C: Newborn Health)

PAGE 310

ASHA Module 6
Simple Skills that Save Lives
406. Perineal Swelling and Infection: If the mother has 
a small tear at the opening of her vagina (or has had 
stitches during the delivery), she should keep the area clean. She can apply cloth dipped in hot water, twice a day and hold it to her genitals. This will give her relief and help the healing. If there is fever, she should be referred to the PHC or CHC. A tablet of paracetomol would help both the pain and the fever. 
7. Post-Partum Mood Changes: Some women may 
suﬀ er from mood changes a/g286  er delivery. They need 
counselling and family support. The changes usually disappear a/g286  er a week or so. If the changes become severe then referral is required.

Objectives of the session
By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Observe and assist during the immediate newborn period in case she is 
present at the time of delivery.
• Observe the baby during the ﬁ  rst hour, during the ﬁ  rst two days and 
during the ﬁ  rst month to take care of the newborn, support and help 
the mother to breastfeed, and to keep the baby warm.
• Know what her speciﬁ  c role is during the home visits, and learn how to 
care for the newborn. 
1. Care of the Baby at the time of Delivery
Many babies die immediately after birth due to 
asphyxia. In case of home delivery, when mild labour pains start, you can manage asphyxiated babies by removing mucus and can initiate respiration with the help of the instruments you have.
You should encourage the mother to start breastfeeding immediately after the delivery, as this will help in quick delivery of placenta and minimises bleeding. Starting to breastfeed immediately after the birth makes the baby stronger.
Chances of the baby’s death and 
getting sick are higher among the babies born before time (pre-term) and in LBW babies, (Weight less than 2500 gm increases the risk and below 1800 gm, the risk is considered very high.)

PAGE 314

ASHA Module 6
Simple Skills that Save Lives
442. Schedule of Home Visits for the care of the Newborn
The purpose of these visits is to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm 
and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, discourage harmful practices such as bo/g308  le feeds, early baths, giving other substances by mouth, and to identify early signs of sepsis or other illnesses in the newborn. 
• The newborn requires a visit immediately a/g286  er birth (or within the ﬁ  rst 
24 hours), and on Day 2, if the baby is born at home. 
• If the baby is born at a facility, persuade and support the mother to stay 
for at least 48 hours, and therefore, the ﬁ  rst two visits are taken care of 
in the institution. However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the nurse/ANM there.
• If the baby is born in a health facility, or at home, you should visit the 
baby on Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additional visits are needed for newborn babies which are LBW, born before term and are sick. 
3. Examining the Newborn at Birth
Steps for you to take “just after” the baby is born 
if the baby is born at home, or if you are present at the delivery,
1. Ask the mother about/observe the ﬂ  uid a/g286  er the waters break.
2. If the ﬂ  uid is yellow/green, as soon as the head is seen (even 
before delivery of complete baby), clean the mouth of the baby 
with gauze piece.
3. As soon as the baby is born, note the time of birth and start 
counting time.
4. Observation of baby at birth or within the ﬁ  rst 30 seconds and 
at 5 minutes a/g286  er birth for movement of limbs, breathing and crying. The ﬁ  gure below will enable the assessment of whether 
the newborn should be recorded as a live or still birth. All six have to be “No” to declare a still birth. Even if one is “yes” the baby should be declared as live birth. 
5. If there is no cry or a weak cry, if there is no breathing or weak 
breathing or gasping, this condition is called Asphyxia. If the baby is asphyxiated (does not breathe at birth), and there is no doctor or nurse, you should try to help and this skill is taught to you, in Module 7. However, in many such newborns, your eﬀ  orts may not make enough diﬀ  erence and you should not feel bad or blame yourself for this. (Management of asphyxia will be taught in Module 7).

466. Provide normal care at birth. 
 /rhombus6   Dry the baby: Immediately a/g286  er delivery, the newborn should be 
cleaned with a so/g286   moist cloth and then the body and the head wiped 
dry with a so/g286   dry cloth. The so/g286   white substance with which the newborn is covered is actually protective and should not be rubbed oﬀ  .
 
/rhombus6  The baby should be kept close to mother’s chest and abdomen. 
 /rhombus6  The baby should be wrapped in several layers of clothing/woollen 
clothing depending upon the season.
 /rhombus6  The room should be warm enough for an adult to feel just 
uncomfortable. The room should be free from strong wind.
8. You should weigh the newborn and decide whether the baby is normal or 
LBW. 
9. Determine whether the baby is term or pre-term.
10. Measure newborn temperature.
First examination of newborn
a. You should conduct the first examination within first 24 hours of delivery 
and look for the following:• Whether the baby has any abnormality such as curved limbs, jaundice, 
bump on head, cle/g286   lip.
• 
How the baby is suckling at the breast.

PAGE 317

Part C
Newborn Health
 47• Whether the baby has loose limbs. 
• Listen to the cry of the baby. • Provide care of eyes. If there is pus/purulent discharge from 
eyes and no doctor or nurse available, apply tetracycline 
ointment. Even for normal eyes, tetracycline is used as a preventive, so even in doubt as to whether it is pus, it could be given. 
• Keep umbilical cord dry and clean. 
b. General precautions the family must take
The newborn is delicate and can easily fall sick if the family and mother are not careful. Y ou should explain some general 
precautions that the family should take. 
• 
Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not 
be bathed until the ﬁ  rst seven days, many families would like to bathe the 
baby on the ﬁ  rst or second day. For a normal baby, if the family insists, the 
baby could be bathed a/g286  er the second day. But in the case of LBW baby, you 
must insist on their waiting for at least seven days. You should explain that 
bathing the baby and leaving it wet or exposed may cause it to get cold and fall sick. Thus, it is be/g308  er to wipe the baby with a warm wet cloth and dry 
the baby immediately.
• Keep the baby away from people who are sick.
• People who are sick with cold, cough, fever, skin infection, diarrhoea, etc. 
should not hold the baby or come in close contact with the baby.
• The newborn baby should not be taken to places where there are other 
sick children.
• The newborn baby should also not be taken to places where there are 
large gatherings of people.
c. What are you expected to do during the newborn visits?
• Enquire and ﬁ  ll the mother
 ’s information on home visit form. (Annexe 6)
• Enquire and ﬁ  ll newborn information on home visit form. These forms 
help you to think about all the steps you need to take. (Annexe 7)
• Take out the necessary equipment from the bag and keep on a clean cloth.
• Wash your hands well as taught.• Then examine the baby – a. measure temperature, b. weigh the baby, and 
c. perform other activities in the sequence provided in the newborn home 
visit form. (Annexe 8 & 9)
• Provide the care of eyes, skin and cord.
• Check that the home visit form is ﬁ  lled in completely.

48d. Learning proper hand washing
You must make sure that your hands are washed properly with soap before touching the baby . Y 
ou should also teach the mother and family members to 
wash their hands before touching the baby.
(Please see Annexe 7 for skills checklist for hand washing)
e. Learning how to measuring temperature 
You should measure the temperature of the newborn using a special thermometer to see if the body temperature is normal or if baby has hypothermia (colder than normal). 
(Please see Annexe 8 for skills checklist for measuring temperature)
f. Learn how to weigh the new born
• Baby should be weighed within two days of birth.
• It is important to w
eigh the baby a/g286  er birth because babies may require 
special care on the basis of the birth weight.
• It is be/g308  er to use a special colour-coded weighing machine meant just for 
weighing newborn which records the weight as green, yellow or red. 
(Please see Annexe 7,8 & 9 for skills checklist)
/rhombus6 If the baby’s weight is “in the green zone: baby’s weight is normal and can 
be managed with normal care as described above.
/rhombus6 If in the yellow zone, the baby is mildly under weight, but can be managed 
at home with extra care as given below. (below 2.5 kg but above 1.8 kg).
/rhombus6 If in the red coloured zone, this means that the baby is very small and 
must be referred to the health centre. These babies also need extra care 
as given below. (less than 1.8 kg)
g. Learn how to take care of babies less than 2.5 kg
Babies whose weight is in the yellow or red zone are small and require extra care as follows:• Provide extra w
armth.
• Family should ensure.
 /rhombus6 Baby is wrapped well with thin sheets and blankets.
 /rhombus6 The head is covered to prevent heat loss.
 /rhombus6 The baby is kept very close to the mother’s abdomen and chest.
 /rhombus6  Warm water ﬁ  lled bo/g308  les wrapped in cloth may be kept on either side 
of the baby’s blankets, when not being kept close to the mother’s body.
 /rhombus6 The baby must be fed more frequently.

PAGE 319

Part C
Newborn Health
 49All babies below 1.8 kg must be taken to a 24x7 facility or other facility known 
to provide referral care for sick newborn and examined by a doctor or nurse.
h. Umbilical cord care
• Cord should be kept clamped, till it dries and falls oﬀ  .  
• 
No application of any medicine is required if there is no bleeding or 
discharge.
• The umbilical cord should be kept clean and dry at all times.
i. Eye care
Skill checklist for applying eye ointment 
If a newborn has pus discharging from its ey es y
ou can put antibiotic 
ointment in the baby’s eyes or a capsule which is available in the market. How to put antibiotic ointment:• Gently pull the baby’s lower eyelid down.• Squeeze a thin line of ointment moving from the inside corner to the 
outside of the eye.
• Do not touch the baby’s eye with the tip of the tube. If the tube touches the 
babies eyes, it shouldn’t be used again.
• If the eyes are swollen with pus, then put the ointment two times a day for 
5 days.
Remember: The usual bathroom scales cannot reliably record small 
diﬀ  erences in weights. That is why bathroom scales cannot accurately record newborn weight and it is not advisable to use these for weighing newborns.

504. Breastfeeding
a. Benefits for the baby
• Early skin-to-skin contact keeps the baby warm.
• It helps in early secretion of breast milk.• Feeding ﬁ  rst milk (colostrum) protects the baby from diseases.
• Helps mother and baby to develop a close and loving relationship.
b. Benefits for the mother
• Helps womb to contract and the placenta is expelled easily.• Reduce the risk of excessive bleeding a/g286  er delivery.
c. Important facts about breastfeeding
• Start breastfeeding immediately or at least within one hour a/g286  er birth. 
Give nothing else, not even water.
• Baby should be put to the mother’s breast even before placenta is 
delivered. It is useful for both the baby as well as the mother.
• Breastfeed as o/g286  en as the baby wants and for as long as the baby wants. 
Baby should be breastfed day and night at least 8-10 times in 24 hours.
• Feeding more o/g286  en helps in production of more milk. The more the baby 
sucks, more milk is produced.
• Baby should not be given any other liquid or foods such as sugar water, 
honey, ghu/g308  i, goat’s/cow’s milk and not even water.Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Counsel mother for breastfeeding.
• Provide breastfeeding support. • Emphasise importance of early and exclusive breastfeeding.• Help mother to express milk and feed babies who cannot suckle at 
birth.
• Manage breastfeeding problems (engorgement, cracked nipple, 
mother feels she does not have enough milk).

 51d. Breastfeeding observation tips
Signs of breastfeeding going well Signs of possible difficulty 
Mother’s body relaxed, comfortable, confident, eye 
contact with baby, touchingMother tense, leans over baby. Not much eye contact or touching
Baby’s mouth well attached, covering most of the areola, opened wide, lower lip turned outwardsMouth not opened wide, not covering areola
Lips around nipple 
Suckling well, deep sucks, bursts with pausesCheeks round, swallowing heard or seenRapid sucks, cheeks tense or sucked in Smacking or 
clicking sounds
Baby calm and alert at breast, stays attached, Mother may feel uterus cramping, some milk may be leaking (showing that milk is flowing)Baby restless or crying, slips off breast; Mother not feeling cramping, no milk is leaking (showing that milk is not flowing)
After feed, breast soft, nipples protruding After feed, breast full or enlarged, nipples may be red, 
cracked, flat or inverted
e. Correct position for breastfeeding
To obtain maximum beneﬁ  t of breastfeeding, the baby should be held in the 
correct position and be put correctly to the breast. The baby is in the correct position when:
• While holding the baby, the mother also supports the baby’s bo/g308  om, and 
not just the head or shoulders.
• Mother holds the baby close to her body.• The baby’s face is facing the breast, with nose opposite the nipple

52f. Counselling tips
• You are there to help the mother, not to take over.
• Use verbal and non-verbal skills to make her feel at 
ease.
• Encourage and praise her; every mother has the 
ability to breastfeed. O/g286  en mothers are worried that 
they are inexperienced and lack the conﬁ  dence. Many 
women do not breastfeed successfully because they 
do not get good advice, support and encouragement.
• If she says something that you do not agree with, do not say ‘that is 
wrong’. Do not make her feel bad or stupid. You can repeat what she says (For example, ‘I hear you saying that you think you don’t have enough milk....’ Ask her why she thinks so. Listen to what she is saying and why). 
• A/g286  er you assess the breastfeeding, you should check the baby’s weight 
gain. 
• Give advice in simple and clear language.
• Make sure the mother understands what you are saying.• Have her repeat what she will try to do. 
g. Why only breastfeeding? 
Giving other food or ﬂ  uid may harm the baby in following ways• It reduces the amount of breast milk taken by the baby.• It may contain germs from water or on feeding bo/g308  les or utensils. These 
germs can cause diarrhoea.
• It may be too dilute, so the baby becomes malnourished.• Baby does not get enough iron from cow’s and goat’s milk and may thus 
develop anaemia.
• Baby may develop allergies.• Baby may have diﬃ   culty digesting animal milk; the milk can cause 
diarrhoea, rashes or other symptoms. Diarrhoea may become persistent. 
• Breast milk provides all the water a baby needs. Babies do not need extra 
water even during the summer months.

 53Managing Common Breastfeeding Problems
Sore nipples
 Causes: poor latch-on or positioning at breast
Management
• Improve attachment and/or position.
• Continue breastfeeding (reduce engorgement if present).
• Build mother’s confidence.
• Advise her to wash breast once a day; not to use soap for this.
•  Put a little breast milk on nipples after feeding is finished (to lubricate the nipple) and air-dry.
• Wear loose clothing.
•  If nipples are very red, shiny, flaky, itchy, and their condition does not get better with above treatment, it 
may be fungus infection. Apply gentian violet paint to nipples after each breastfeed for five days. If the 
condition does not improve, refer to a doctor.
Inverted nipples
Sometimes the nipple will retract in to the breast, and can be checked even during pregnancy. The best treatment is to encourage the mother to gently pull out the nipple and roll it, several times in a day. 
Not enough milk
Causes: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding; infrequent feeding; giving fluids other than breast milk; mother’s anxiety, exhaustion, insecurity; inadequate family support.
Management
• Decide whether there is enough milk or not:
  /rhombus6  Does the baby pass urine six times or more each day?
  /rhombus6  Has the baby gained sufficient weight? (During the 1st week there is 
usually a small weight loss, after that a newborn should gain 150-
200 gm per week.)
  /rhombus6  Is the baby satisfied after feeds?
• Re-assure mother.
• If there is not enough milk, have the baby feed more often.
• Check breastfeed to observe mother attachment and positioning of the 
mother and baby.
• Encourage rest. Emphasise the mother to drink and eat more.
• Praise her and return for follow-up.

PAGE 324

ASHA Module 6
Simple Skills that Save Lives
54Engorged and painful breasts (very full breasts)
Causes: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding, poor attachment, incomplete 
emptying of breasts, restricting the length of the feeds.
Management
• Prevent by:
  /rhombus6 Starting breastfeeding soon after delivery and
                feeding often..
  /rhombus6 Ensuring correct attachment.
  /rhombus6 Encouraging on-demand feeding.
• If baby is able to suckle, feed more frequently, help with positioning.
•  If the baby is not able to attach, apply warm compresses to breast, 
gently massage from outside toward the nipple and express some milk until the areola is soft, then put baby to the breast, making sure that the attachment is correct.
•  Have baby feed often to empty out the breasts. If it is not possible, ask 
the mother to express some milk herself.
•  If breasts are red and hard, continue to feed often. Use warm 
compresses and gently massage breasts towards nipple. Take mother’s temperature. If she has fever, mother should visit the doctor. She should continue to breastfeed (from both sides) even if she is taking antibiotics. 
Expressing milk by hand
1. Wash hands with soap and water.
2. Place a warm compress on the breast for a few minutes if desired.3. Gently massage the breast starting from the chest moving toward the 
nipple; do this in a circle (near the underarm, and then to the bo/g308  om of 
the breast etc.), so that all parts of the breast are massaged.
4. Lean forward and support the bo/g308  om of the breast with one hand.5. Hold the areola between thumb and two ﬁ  ngers of other hand. Put her 
hand on the areola above the nipple and the two ﬁ  ngers on the areola 
below the nipple.
6. Press toward the chest (about 1-2 cm) and then squeeze the milk 
reservoirs beneath the areola (do not squeeze the nipple).
7. Press and release the thumb and ﬁ  rst ﬁ  nger several times until the milk 
drips out. Use a clean bo/g308  le or a cup to collect the milk. Milk may drip at the beginning and then spray out a/g286  er it starts ﬂ  owing.
8. Rotate the thumbs and ﬁ  nger around the areola so that the milk is 
removed from all the reservoirs.
9. Repeat with the other breast.

56Mothers and families think that in the following situations, their milk is not 
enough, but in fact, these do not affect the breast milk supply:
• Age of mother
• Sexual intercourse
• Return of menstruation
• Disapproval of relatives and neighbours
• Age of baby
• Caesarean Section
• Many children
• Simple, ordinary diet

 57Keeping newborn warm and the problem of hypothermia 
Why is it important to keep baby warm after delivery?
Babies have diﬃ   culty maintaining their temperature at 
birth and in the ﬁ  rst day of life.They come out wet, and 
lose heat quickly. If they get cold, they use up energy, and can become sick. LBW and pre-term babies are at greater risk of ge/g308  ing cold.
When and why do most newborns get cold?Most newborns lose heat in ﬁ  rst minute a/g286  er 
 delivery. 
They are born wet. If they are le/g286   wet and naked, they lose a lot of heat to the air. A newborn baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn baby is not properly dried, wrapped, and its head is not kept covered, it can lose 2 to 4 degree Celsius within 10-20 minutes.
Example: If the baby’s temperature was 97.7 degree Fahrenheit (36.5 degree 
Celsius) (normal temperature) at the time of birth and if there was a loss of 2.7 degree Fahrenheit because the baby was not properly dried and covered, the body temperature will become 95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), which is below normal. 
What is the term for a situation when a baby’s temperature falls below 
normal?When a baby has a temperature below normal, it suﬀ  ers from hypothermia.
  
What happens to a baby with hypothermia?A baby who is cold, and has a low temperature (hypothermia) suﬀ  ers from:
• 
Decreased ability to suckle at the breast, leading to poor feeding and 
weakness.5. Keeping the Newborn Warm
Objectives of the session
By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Identify the newborn whose body temperature is less than 
normal and whose body temperature is more than normal. 
• Teach mothers how to keep the newborns warm.
• Teach mothers how to re-warm cold babies.• Teach mothers how to control newborn temperature in hot 
weather.
• Learn to take the temperature.

58• Increased susceptibility to infections.
• Increased risk of death, especially in LBW and pre-term babies.
How can you tell if a baby is hypothermic?
• The early sign is cold feet.
• Then, the body becomes cold.
• 
The best method is to measure the baby’s body temperature.
(This skill has already been taught to you)
How to keep newborns warm
• Before delivery, warm up the room (warm enough for adults).• Immediately a/g286  er delivery, dry the baby. 
• Put a cap on the baby since a lot of heat could be lost though its head.• Place in skin-to-skin contact with mother.• Cover or put clothes on the baby, wrap it up with clean cloth, and place it 
close to its mother.
• Initiate early breastfeeding.• Bathing for newborns:  
/rhombus6  It is best to wait until the  second day to bathe the baby. One should 
wait seven days in case of LBW baby. 
  /rhombus6  If the family insists on bathing the ﬁ  rst day, please ask them to delay 
for at least six hours to give the baby time to adjust with its new 
environment.
  /rhombus6  For small and pre-term babies, do not give a bath until the baby 
gains weight (this could be few weeks) and weight of baby become 2,000 gm.
• To keep a small baby clean, you can give a light oil massage but making 
sure that the room is warm and the baby is not le/g286   uncovered for more than 10 minutes. DO NOT pour oil into any oriﬁ  ce, like the nose or ears at any time.
• Keep baby loosely clothed and wrapped.
• If it is very warm outside, make sure the baby is not too heavily clothed 
and wrapped; the baby can also get too hot. 
• Wherever possible, insist on referral to a facility that is managing sick 
newborns. If this is not immediately possible, begin the following steps:Warming

Newborn Health
 59How to re-warm a baby getting cold?
<97 degree Fahrenheit (36.1 degree Celsius) or too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit 
(35.0 degree Celsius) 
• Increase the room temperature.
• Remove any wet or cold blankets and clothes.
• Hold the baby with its skin next to its mother’s skin (skin-to-skin contact) and place a warmed cloth 
(not too hot to avoid burns) on its back or chest. As this cloth cools down, replace it with another 
warmed one, and repeat until the baby is warmer. Continue until the baby’s temperature reaches the normal range.
• Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother.
• Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the blood glucose level.
  /rhombus6 A common problem in hypothermic babies.
If a baby is too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), follow the above advice, and
• Place skin-to-skin, and once the baby is a little warmer, then clothe baby and place in a bed pre-
warmed with warm clothes, or a hot stone or hot water bottle. (Remove these articles before putting baby on the bed.)
• In an institutional delivery, there should be a newborn corner available with a radiant 
warmer, or some other suitable heating arrangement where the newborn baby can be kept.

606. Management of fever in newborn
A baby has fever if the temperature is above 99 degree Fahrenheit (37.2 
degree Celsius).  In the case of high body temperature of the baby during 
summer, verify in the following manner whether this is due to the body being overdressed or does it really have fever: 
• Unwrap the baby and take oﬀ   its cap.• Ventilate the room too to cool the baby. • Ask the mother to start breastfeeding. • If there is a source of extra heat (like a ﬁ  re) in the room, put it out.• Wait for 30 minutes and take the temperature once again. 
If the baby’s temperature returns to normal, explain to the mother that in very 
warm weather, the baby does not have to kept covered with additional cloth 
or kept wrapped.
If the temperature is still above normal a/g286  er the above measures have been 
taken, refer the baby for treatment.

and

family
members
to
spend
time
with
the

as
it
matters
a
lot.
Time
has
to

Note
Wasted
expenditure
on
unnecessary
services
is
also
an
issue.
Families
tend
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
in
commercial
health
foods
which
are
very
costly.
This
money
is
better
spent
in
buying
cheap,
lower
cost
locally
available
nutritious
foods.
Tonics
and
health
drinks
are
also
a
waste
for
the
poor
family.
Unnecessary
and
costly
treatments
by
local
doctors
for
the
recurrent
bouts
of
diarrhoea
and
minor
colds
and
coughs
could
also
be
a
drain.
One
of
the
important
services
that
you
can
perform
is
in
making
people
aware
that
such
expenditures
are
unnecessary.

Given
below
are
examples
of
understanding
that
ASHA
formed
in
two
children:
Banu
was
a
nine
month
old
girl
with
moderate
malnutrition.
She
is
being
breastfed
and
only
this
month
was
started
on
complementary
food.
She
eats
rice
and
dal
from
her
parents’
plate
while
they
are
eating,
once
at
about
10.00
am
and
then
about
6.00
p.m.
She
had
diarrhoea
once,
one
month
ago,
but
no
other
illness.
You
gave
her
ORS
and
she
became
alright
with
it.
She
does
not
go
to
the
anganwadi
or
get
rations
from
there.
Her
immunisation
is
on
schedule.
Rafay
is
an
18
month
old
boy
who
is
severely
underweight.
He
has
no
odema,
but
there
is
some
wasting.
He
cannot
go
to
the
hospital
because
his
mother
cannot
leave
her
younger
child
and
she
also
has
to
go
to
work
as
she
is
the
only
earning
member.
Rafay
is
not
being
breastfed,
but
gets
to
eat
roti,
dal
and
vegetables.
He
eats
about
half
a
roti
or
one
roti
thrice
a
day.
But
his
mother
complains
that
he
does
not
eat
a
lot
and
has
very
poor
appetite.
He
has
frequent
episodes
of
respiratory
infection
but
no
other
illness.
His
immunisation
schedule
is
complete.

Important
Sterilisation
and

do
not
protect
against
STIs
and
Human
Immuno-deficiency
Virus
(HIV).
So,
for
protection
from
STIs
and
HIV,
a
condom
should
be
used
during
every
sexual
intercourse,
if
the
woman
is
at

of
contracting
them.

Guidance
that
you
should
give
to
the
family
•
Keep
the
baby
clothed
from
the
very
first
day.
In
winter,
cover
the
baby
with
a
blanket.•
Do
not
bathe
a
baby
until
its
weight
is
2000gm.
•
Ensure
that
mother’s
nails
are
cut
and
that
her
hands
are
washed
every
time
the
baby
is
breastfed.
•
After
returning
from
the
toilet,
all
family
members
must
wash
their
hands
with
soap
before
touching
the
baby.
•
High
risk
babies
should
be
breastfed
after
every
two
hours.
•
If
baby
is
not
suckling
milk,
squeeze
the
breast
milk
in
a
small
bowl
and
then
feed
the
baby
with
a
spoon.
•
The
weight
of
high
risk
babies
should
improve
every
week
from
second
week.
If
this
does
not
happen,
counsel
them
to
consult
you.
•
Ask
them
to
call
you
immediately
if
the
baby
develops
any
of
the
following:
All
limbs
become
limp,
stops
feeding,
has
chest
indrawing,
has
fever,
and
is
cold
to
touch.
What
should
you
do
if
the
baby
is
at
high
risk?
