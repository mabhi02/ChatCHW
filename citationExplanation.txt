Citation steps

1. Converted the pdf to .txt format
2. Added page numbers as breaks 
3. Chunked with same amount of tokens and chunk overlap as we did originally (increased number of chunks slightly from 211 to 237)
    a. Made sure page and its number are not seperated 
4. Upserted to pinecone with id number and text of the chunk
5. Stored chunk, id number, and page numbers contained within the chunk in a csv
6. When extract the chunk, match the id in the metadata to the csv. This gives us access to the page number column
7. Aggregate all the page numbers used and display them at the end, thus creating citations.
