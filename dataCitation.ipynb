ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.  \n",

      "The sixth and seventh modules cover areas whose content is already \n",
      "familiar to the ASHA. In addition, this module includes the development of speciﬁ  c competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, \n",
      "intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.  \n",

One of the key components of the mission is creating a band of female health volunteers, appropriately named “Accredited Social Health Activist” (ASHA) ineach village within the identified States. These ASHAs would act as a ‘bridge’between the rural people and health service outlets and would play a centralrole, in achieving national health and population policy goals. ASHAs are to be selected by community, out of residents within the community. They would work on voluntary basis, although compensation would be providedto them for specific activities and services. ASHA guidelines clearly lay downthe accountability mechanisms. The induction training for ASHA would becompleted in 23 days spread in five rounds over a period of 12 months to befollowed by periodic re-training for about two days once every alternate month.

      "Village people are not as rich as city people. They have to face many difficulties. They depend on land and farming. Some of them also work as wage labourers innearby towns. In many villages, rearing cattle is a source of income. Most farmersdepend upon rains. Many work as artisans. They work hard to live their life. Some people are too poor. They are grouped as below poverty line (BPL) as per Government criteria. Often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and othermarginalized groups. Families belonging to BPL are eligible for special benefitsunder government schemes. A village may have different settlements fordifferent castes. Everyone needs health care. Yet some groups of people are vulnerable to sickness. The poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people needhealth care more often. Their health needs are not adequately met. They havelittle or no money. At times they have to take loans at very high interest rates to 3 PAGE 14 get admission in hospitals or to buy medicines for their kids. Your role is to guide them to get good care in time and that is affordable. Village people have a practical sense of solving problems with simple resources. Thus they should be involved in village health planning to assesshealth needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address thecommon problems. Schools, fair price shops, water, electricity, seeds, fertilizers, credit, animal care, bus/jeep, roads, employment, forest produce, common grazing grounds, post-office, haat—we need all these services in the village. Health care is just onemore. It is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village. As ASHA, youshall do your best to help your own people in their struggle for health and sharejoys of life.

Everybody's participation is necessary.NGO workers, school teachers, representatives of self help groups will also helpin micro planning. You should ensure that marginalized population groups suchas Scheduled castes, tribes, minorities and women are adequately involved inthe planning process. When people participate in planning, they also help inoffering solutions and carrying out the tasks. Most villages will have health and sanitation committee. The committee members take initiative for development of village health plans. Village healthplanning needs some facilitators They bring people together, activate them tothink and plan with people, map out problems and encourage solutions.Depending on the availability some NGOs workers can provide facilitation.Teachers can also help you. You should work proactively with anganwadi behenand nurse Didi to decide on the venue and timings for the planning meeting. Village health plans provide a framework for health related actions. Many actions lead to health. Village planning is a community approach to solveproblems. You will learn more about it in the subsequent exposures of ourlearning programme.8 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 15 Example: Development of a plan for tackling sanitation problem in village Let village teachers, Nursedidi, Anganwadi behen, artisans, Panchayat members, NGO workers meet and form a core group. You will be one of the members ofthis group. This group should go around village observing village sanitation and other problems. You may involve students in village rally so as to raise awareness ofsanitation issues inform about time and venue of planning meeting. Songs andstreet plays also invite attention of people. Then gather in a central place open to all. Draw a village map on a big paper or a wall. Ask people to draw their house in the map. Map waste water cesspoolsin village. Discuss about problems. The village planning may take 2-3 days also. Ask people sources of wastewater flowing in the street or in cesspools. Mark the house with things like tamarind seeds, small stones etc. Mark houses havingfever cases. The Nursedidi, and the Anganwadi behen and MPW will check thehouses.

Proper information and advice help people to avoid diseases andstay healthy. Health information is a lasting asset. Currently villagers especially poor women, men and adolescents do not have access to information on health issues. Youcan fill this gap and act as a local resource on health issues. Availability ofinformation will trigger changes in health promoting behaviours and adoptionof healthy practices. /square6We should select issues close to people’s hearts and needs.

Hospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. But first we need to take care of our body. You can preventdiseases, promote health and prolong life. We say Aarogyam dhansampada. This means health is real wealth. Health makes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. Ill health keeps us away from work and livelihood. Ill health means spending on doctors andmedicines. In villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle topay for hospital expenses. The money people spend on tobacco and liquoralso causes ill health.

Cutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned. PAGE 26 OOuurr MMoouutthh aanndd tteeeetthh Our teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in the tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums. We must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine whathappens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and notcleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we don’t clean our mouth aftermeals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash. Discourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. That causes stains. Smoking also makes teeth dirty.

Children are often in habit of taking water from vessel by dipping their handsespecially after play. Use a ladle (handle-cup) instead. We can also make water safer by boiling it for about 15-20 minutes after therolling starts. Chlorine addition is just one way of making water safe. Overnight storageof water makes it practically safe.Boiling is good, but also needs fuel. If you have chlorine drops, add 2 drops in one bucket. Use this water after keepinghalf hour.

Generally a child triples its birth weight at the age of one year. Adult maintains body weight. Weightreduces in old age. Underweight is because of under-eating. Majority of village women and young girls have low weight. Poor diet leads to poor growth in children. Severalchildren in our society are malnourished. Over-eating leads to storage of fat in the body. Fat people can get certain illnesses—high BP, heart attacks, diabetes, joint pains etc.31 OUR HEALTH DEPENDS ON FOOD WE EAT!

For a house we need stones, bricks, mud and cement, wood, tins or roof, tiles, pipesand wires etc. From these we build foundation, pillars, walls,rooms, windows, doors, floors, water supply, lighting, kitchenchulha, drainage etc. All these parts have different purposes.Similarly in the body we have many parts or organs fordifferent functions. Together they make the human body. Different organs doing different work are linked together as organ systems. Various systems do various tasksnecessary for life. So we have systems for breathing, bloodcirculation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. And all the bodysystems work in cooperation. The body has control systems for this, viz brain,nerves and hormones. Bones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement possible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of differentshapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints makemovement possible. Hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. Andjoints are so different.Body Mapping and Overview of OrgansBody Mapping andOverview of Organs 9 In this lesson we will learn about Different organs of our body, mapping organs on the bodyand about which organdoes what. PAGE 40 You may have seen the guts of sheep or chicken. Human gut is about 22 ft long- more than a room length. Gut is part of the digestive system and digests/absorbs food. While passing through, food will be mixed with secretions from different glands. It also throws off the waste. Whatever body cannot put to use in sent in large intestine and later leaves body through anal opening. Digestion gives us energy to work and nutrients to build and repair the body. Respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let out. Oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy. We have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body. This goes in rounds thanks to our heart pumping each second.

That will fill a water tanker of 10000 liters in 24 hrs. The heart keepsyour blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs andnutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body.Younger you are faster is your heart beat. The blood carries nutrients andoxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks andwagons in the body, through the vessels. Urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat.Reproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction and continuation of life on earth. We know the world through our five windows. We call them sense organs. The eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure,vibration and pain. Thanks to the Nervous system, we respond to these signals. Human brain is most complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or changealertness. This is necessary for our survival. The Nervous system controls severalbody functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.34 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 41 MMaappppiinngg aanndd lleeaarrnniinngg mmoorree aabboouutt oouurr bbooddyy Some of our organs are seen from outside like eyes, ears, breasts, testes. Let us see where the other organs are – Bony skeleton and attached muscles give body its basic frame. Skin covers all the body and protects it from outside environment. Soft organs are inside thechest and abdomen. Brain is inside the skull. A butterfly like important gland (Thyroid) is present in front of the neck. Goitre is actually a swelling of this. Iodized salt prevents it. When we take a deep breath the chest expands. The lungs inside the chest and fill like balloons. The wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs.It indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk. Fear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times in a minute. We can feel the beats pounding in the chest. Put an ear to yourfriend’s chest.\n",

Put an ear to yourfriend’s chest. Can you hear heart beats? Where is it? Heart is just left of themiddle of the chest. Pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of thebody. These carry blood from heart to all parts. Can you see the veins under yourskin? Blood is brought back to heart through veins. Let us drink a glass of cold water. Do you feel it going down from throat to stomach? Food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upperabdomen. Stomach stores and digests food for 1-2 hours. Then the food passesdown the gut. Do you feel the rumbling in abdomen when you are hungry? A long coil of gut is in the middle of abdomen. This does further digestion. The long coils lead toa wider short pipe called colon. The well known appendix sits on the colon onlower right corner. Appendix does not serve any special purpose in the body. Colon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen walls– going up from lower right side, and then becomes horizontal going left. Then it goes down to the bagstoring waste. Finally it reaches the anus. Liver is high up on the right side. A swollen liver can be felt below the lower right ribs. Similarly on the left side we have a small spleen. In some diseasessuch as Malaria, spleen becomes very big. We can feel it below the left side ribs.35 BODY MAPPING AND OVERVIEW OF ORGANS PAGE 42 Two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of abdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes. One feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time. That is where the urinary bladder is. From bladder the urine is let out througha single tube opening on genitals.

From the testes two thick cords carry sperms to two small bags close to urethra. They make semencarrying sperms. The semen is thrown out through urethra at the end ofsexual intercourse. In women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus –the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in thelower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones. The womb grows inpregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the wombon the abdomen. Two egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. The tubes have free finger like ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovariesflank the uterus. Outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women.In men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the end of a long muscular penis. In women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. Inner vulva is soft tags of flesh. These are aptly called inner lips of vulva. The inner lips are connectedabove at clitoris. Clitoris is small external bud like organ. A fleshy cushion ofvulva–called outer lips–protect all these parts. The vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. Hymen, a thin sheet with holes covers the vaginal opening. This may be torn after puberty. Afterpuberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. Breasts also grow in women atthe age of maturity. At maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.36 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 43 Many young boys and girls are unawares of these differences. During adolescence their bodies start changing and maturing. They become sensitiveto the differences. You will know more about the health needs of theadolescents in subsequent books.

Diseases amongst women and young girls are not taken up seriously. Women work both at home and outside. Women have to spend considerable time and effort for child care. Fetching water and firewood take many hours of hard work by women. Tedious work in farm can lead to health problems. Women work hard but get lower wages. Women get less food at home. In fact they eat at the end when every one in the family has eaten. Most women are anemic andweak. Their weights are too low to be healthy. Women are given less opportunity for education.Women have less say in decisions in the family.Women and Health 10 In this lesson we will learn about Why women suffer more ill health and neglect Attitudes of society on women’s health PAGE 45 Many men women treat women badly, and even beat them. Women are also sexuallyassaulted. Such women suffer frominjuries and other health problems. Women’s health problems are often ignored or treated late. They have toget permission of the in-laws orhusband’s even for health check up. Theyoften have no money to pay for healthcare on their own. Our health services arealso not fully sensitive to women’s healthcare needs. Infertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. But usually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis-treated. If a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. In reality it all depends on the man’s sperm.

You can check from your anganwadi behen as how many boysand girls are registered at Aanganwadi centre. Women bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. They also bear burden of preventing pregnancies. Most contraceptive methods are for women and veryfew for men. Women’s reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually transmitted infections. Vagina provides a larger surface,delicate skin, longer time to hold fluids, moistness tomake germs stay alive for longer. So they get moreinfections than men. Even illnesses affect women differently. Malaria fever can cause abortions, affect growth of baby in the womb. On top of all, women are married young. They suffer its damage in several ways-socially, economically, andto health.39 WOMEN AND HEALTH PAGE 46 Alcoholic husbands exploit women in several ways. They treat their family member harshly everyday to show off the manhood. It makes women’s already difficult lives all the more miserable. There are fewer amenities for toilets for women. In the village, they have to go to answer nature’s call either early morning or evening. Villages may have no air pollution, but that is not true for women. They work in kitchen smoke for 4-5 hrs everyday. It gives them coughs and headaches. And do you know, still they are hardy enough to live longer than men.

You have to match the group, topic and methodof communication. Mismatch of these three will not produce anyimpact. For instance for bringing behavioral change aboutsanitary latrine, we need to talk to women (and men). We can plan and do it as follows: Get a group of 5-10 women/men (not more) in somebody’s house. It is good to select a venue which is accessible to all especially women from scheduled castes/ tribes are comfortable. It is useful to select a house, which already have a sanitary latrine. You need to communicate to people in advance about the venue and timing of this meeting. You can also talk with members of self help group in the village. 11 In this lesson we will learn about How to organize a group meeting PAGE 48 We can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. Just provide the beginning or let someone begin. Gradually other members of group will also start participating in the discussion and share their problems. If we have a model or flip chart about sanitary latrine, we can share it now. If someone in the village has got a sanitary latrine to a smokeless one, that can be a demonstration. Explain the basics of the sanitary latrine, and how one can make it. A good flip chart will have all that explained in pictures. Discuss ways of how Panchayat can help families in constructing sanitary latrines and what assistance is available.

In this lesson wewill learn only aboutgermillnesses. PAGE 60 Not all illnesses make a scar after injury–common cold, flu, malaria, sore- eyes are some examples. But some illnesses cause a scar inside the body. TB is one example. It leaves a scar in the lungs after cure. Some illnesses have a cause in the mind–mental illnesses. Healing is a natural process. Good nutrition and immunity help healing. Healing leads to cure. And most illnesses heal. But some can get worse as they have no cures. Can you name some diseases with no cure. GGeerrmmss,, wwoorrmmss,, iinnsseeccttss--iillllnneesssseess aanndd iimmmmuunniittyy Most of the common illnesses are due to germs, small insects and worms. We can often see worms in the excreta.

Examples of germ illnesses are: Malaria, chickenpox TB, measles, leprosy, many types of diarrheas and dysentery. The gravity and period of illness vary with thegerm-type and our resistance to that germ. Immunity is the resistance of our body to fight germs. Immunity develops as body gets experience of fighting germs. Immunity helps us recover from a germ-illness. Immunity may be natural like in leprosy.

Sex with multiple partners without condom is the risky sexual behaviour. Men having sex withmen also exposes them to risk of infection. TThhee wwiinnddooww ppeerriioodd After exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12 weeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period to get anHIV test. In our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place through sexual route. There are not “high risk groups” but there are some people whohave high risk behaviour. AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour. AAIIDDSS iiss tthhee iillllnneessss AIDS is the illness due to HIV infection. This may take months and years after HIV test is positive.

Breast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. No other feeds including water are necessary. Consult a Nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeedingproblem even after your help. Mother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. On delivery the breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. The baby should befed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ-attacks. This should not be thrown away. Breast milk provides for all the needs of the baby.

They are also given at thesub centers and the PHC. Vaccines need cold storage during transportation to retain their power. Child gets fever after DPT injections. This can be treated with ‘Paracetomol’ tablet or liquid. 25 In this lesson we will learn about Vaccines for six dangerous illnesses of childhood. Importance of Vit A dosesTo convince parents to take their children forimmunization. PAGE 88 BCG is usually injected on the baby’s left shoulder. A scar is formed six weeks after injection. It shows that the child may have become immune to Lung TB. Give also five doses of vitamin A. Start from nine months age, and give every six months. This protects children from night blindness. Vit A also boosts child’s immunity against germs. We all know that many parents deny their children immunization. Immunization boosts body’s fighting power against diseases caused by germs. You can help them by explaining benefits of immunization.

You will learn about methods for preventing unwanted pregnancy, care for reproductive tract infections, prevention of HIV/AIDS and care to be given in case of malaria, TB or other such health problems as well as minor ailments in Books No. 3 and 4. 1 PAGE 109 Menstruation and Fertility  Duration of bleeding : three-five days  Bleeding recurs after : 25-35 days  Flow : without clots In a regular 28-day menstrual cycle the mid 10 days (10th-20th day) of the cycle are fertile period during which pregnancy can occur, the first day being the day when the bleeding starts. 2 Normal Menstrual Cyclelining breaking downIt is very important for women to know about how their body functions especially in relation to reproductive health because they are uniquely gifted with the capacity to give birth to a baby. You know that by the time a girl reaches the age of 10-13 years, a number of changes occur in her body preparing her to meet the complex child birth process. The normal menstrual cycle has the following characteristics: blood & tissue being lost through the cervix & vaginacervix (neck of uterus)uterus vaginaovary developing egg (ovum) fallopian tube egg has not been fertilized lining of uterus not needed to grow a baby PAGE 110 9 A woman can become pregnant from the age of 13-16 (when her periods begin), up to 45-55 years, (when they ultimately stops). When they stops it is called menopause. If the pattern of menstruation is different from that given above or there is bleeding again after menopause or the bleeding continues after 55 years of age a woman must consult a doctor. A girl or woman should consult a doctor if:  bleeding lasts for more than six days  there is too much bleeding especially clots  there is bleeding in between the cycle  there is pain during menstruation  there is infrequent bleeding  there is bleeding during sexual activity How reproduction occurs All females produce “egg” and males produce “sperms” which unite inside the womb of the woman and produce a foetus.

      "during sexual activity How reproduction occurs All females produce “egg” and males produce “sperms” which unite inside the womb of the woman and produce a foetus. This grows into a baby. The sex of the baby is determined by sex chromosomes, through which we inherit our parents’ traits. A woman’s egg has X chromosome and a man’s sperm has either X or Y chromosome (which we may call girl sperm or boy sperm respectively). At the time of fertilization, the X male chromosome of female egg meets either a girl sperm (XX) resulting in a baby girl or a boy sperm (XY) resulting in baby boy. Neither the man nor the woman can do MENSTRUATION AND FERTILITY ManSperm EggWomanSperm enters the egg and unites with itFoetus, which grows into a baby PAGE 111 10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA anything to make sure that either a boy or girl is born – this happens completely by chance inside the woman’s body depending on whether a boy-sperm (XY) or girl-sperm (XX) meet with the egg. Hence it is wrong to blame a woman for not giving birth to a baby boy, as is generally done. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: As ASHA, you may come across some couples in your village who have no children, or the woman is unable to get pregnant after one or two abortions. If the woman is 20 years of age or above and has been living with her husband for two years, leading a normal marital life but has not become pregnant, advise the couple to consult a nurse or directly go for a check-up to a doctor. Both partners must go together for infertility treatment as either or both of them may be having some problem, which needs treatment. Please note that couples often live apart because one of them has migrated in search of a job. It may be difficult for such couples to have a baby. It is also possible that women are being blamed for having only girls. Some women may be deserted by their husbands and families for not producing a son. You should clearly communicate the role of men and women in deciding the sex of a baby. PAGE 112 Care during Pregnancy3 Pregnancy is\n",

PAGE 112 Care during Pregnancy3 Pregnancy is a natural event in the life of women of reproductive age group. However, during pregnancy and childbirth some problems may arise which can threaten the life of the mother, baby or both. It is possible to identify women with some problems quite early if they have routine ante-natal check-up. This will enable them to access specialist care. Care during pregnancy is important to monitor progress and growth of the baby, detect complications at the earliest and treat them accordingly. During the visit the woman and her family should be advised proper nutrition, rest, exercise. They can make plans about where to deliver. This will help both the woman and baby to have a happy and healthy outcome. Minor ailments of pregnancy (e.g. vomiting, heart burn, constipation, backache etc.) are looked after during ANC. PregnancySchedule of pregnancy care  The first visit is recommended as soon as the woman feels that she is pregnant This is called registration of pregnancy, which ensures that all pregnant women receive care throughout pregnancy.  In villages/districts where female foetuses are being eliminated before birth, it is further important that pregnancy is registered early. PAGE 113 12 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA  The second visit should be made between the fourth and sixth month  The third visit should be planned in the eighth month  An additional visit in the ninth month would help provide better care.  If the health worker identifies health problems during these visits, a visit to a doctor will become necessary. What is done during pregnancy check-up and care?  During the first check-up the complete history of this pregnancy and previous pregnancies, if any, and whether the woman has had any medical/surgical problem in the past is taken.  The ANM will weigh the woman to see whether the woman is gaining adequate weight during pregnancy, and also check blood pressure (using a balloon-like instrument), and see whether it is normal or not.  Breast examination to check whether breasts and the nipples are normal will\n",

For this, a pregnant woman should eat more green, leafy vegetables like palak and sarson, dals, milk, jaggery, eggs, fish, meat, etc. Taboos and restrictions on a pregnant woman’s diet, such as not allowing certain vegetables, fruits, milk and ghee, might in fact harm her and the baby.  Pregnant women are entitled to get food from the anganwadi centre.  A pregnant woman should not fast. This deprives her and the growing baby inside the uterus of essential food.  Pregnant women should not carry out heavy manual labour, like working on construction sites, famine relief, brick kilns, etc. Other members of the family and community should help to reduce her work burden.CARE DURING PREGNANCY PAGE 115 14 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA  Pregnant, adolescent girls are especially likely to be under-nourished and are more likely to suffer problems during delivery. They need extra nutritious food and help for safe delivery at a health facility.  Sometimes there are overweight pregnant women who need to avoid eating fat-rich food like oil, ghee, sugar, etc), but they should continue to eat vegetables, fruits, nuts and milk which are rich in iron, calcium, vitamins and minerals. They should also take regular exercise and consult a doctor. Anaemia in pregnancy Lack of blood in the body is known as anaemia. It is very common in our country. Anaemia in pregnancy leads to complications in pregnant women and can even result in the death of mother and baby. You should be aware that a pregnant woman with anaemia looks pale, feels tired, complains of breathlessness on carrying out routine work, and might have swelling of the face and body. Anaemia can be prevented and treated completely if the woman follows the advice of ANM/doctor.  Anaemia is treated with iron tablets, which have to be taken daily for many months during pregnancy or by giving injections. If the anaemia is severe, hospitalization and blood transfusion may be required.  To prevent anaemia, all pregnant women need to take one iron tablet daily, starting after three months of pregnancy. In this way, she must take 100 tablets.  While giving iron tablets, the woman should be advised that some\n",

In this way, she must take 100 tablets.  While giving iron tablets, the woman should be advised that some side effects might occur. However, they can be managed in the following ways:  Nausea or occasional vomiting – this can be prevented/avoided by taking the tablet after meals.  Constipation – this can be managed if the woman drinks more water and eats fruits.  Black stools or mild diarrhoea. Note  Iron tablets should not be taken along with tea as that reduces its absorption.  Anaemia, pregnant women must have deliveries in hospital. Malaria in pregnancy  Malaria during pregnancy might be fatal for the woman and may cause abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight babies or premature labour.

PAGE 117 16 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA As ASHA you should advise the pregnant woman and her family about the potential danger signs during pregnancy, delivery and after delivery, the post-partum period. If she has any of the following problems, she should be taken immediately to the nearest functional FRU directly:  Any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.  Heavy vaginal bleeding during and following delivery, especially if the woman is feeling weak and faint.  Severe headache/blurring of vision.  Convulsions or loss of consciousness.  Labour pains lasting more than 12 hours.  Labour pains before eight months or 32-36 weeks of pregnancy.  Premature rupture of the bag of waters or leakage of water from uterus membranes, leaking etc.  Failure of the placenta to come out within 30 minutes after delivery.  Baby stops kicking inside the womb PAGE 118 Intra-Natal Care and Post-Natal Care4 Intra-natal care Delivery occurs normally after nine months of pregnancy. If delivery is before time special care for baby may be needed. As far as possible a pregnant woman should have the delivery in a health centre or hospital even if pregnancy is normal. This is mainly because during delivery, labour complications may suddenly occur which can threaten the life of mother, baby or both. During delivery the time between starting of a problem to death of mother, baby or both is so short that it may not be possible to save the life of mother or baby if the pregnant woman is not already in a well-equipped health centre or hospital.  Ensure the availability of transport to the FRU/transport money available for the same, and how to access it in case of emergency and escort her.  Find out the money/other provisions available under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) for your area, who has the money and what is the procedure to get it and the reporting needed.

In this period, the changes, which have taken place in the organs/system during pregnancy in the woman come back to normal, except breasts. Mother and the newborn are susceptible to some problems which you should be aware of, so that they can be guided for treatment/referral. Care during post-natal period  During post-natal period, a woman requires nutritious and balanced diet, which is rich in iron, calcium, vitamins and proteins. She should increase her intake of green leafy vegetables, pulses, jaggery, etc. and eat to her satisfaction. She should also take more milk during this period.  Under nourished women are given supplementary food from Anganwadi Centre by AWW. Ensure that they do come and receive it. \n",

A woman can have sex after six weeks, as by that time any perineal tear or other procedures carried out during child birth. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:  Advise the woman at least one check-up within two weeks of delivery.  Advise the women to visit the ANM for minor complaints e.g. sore breasts, cracked nipples, foul smelling discharge, pain in legs etc.  Assist ANMs in conducting post-natal clinic and screening women and children with danger signals.  Advise registration of birth.  Counsel on exclusive breast-feeding for the newborn which:  helps in better involution of the uterus.  can produce lactational amenorrhea and thus act as natural contraceptive.  Counsel them on contraceptive needs (temporary/permanent) as required and help the women/family to get the same.  Ask mother to report if there is:  Excessive vaginal bleeding  Loss of consciousness  Fast or difficult breathing  Fever  Severe abdominal pain PAGE 121 Newborn Care 5 Every newborn needs certain essential elements of care immediately at birth and the first 28 days of life, irrespective of mode of delivery/weight of baby.

PAGE 124 Unsafe Abortions & Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) 6 You know that sometimes unwanted pregnancies occur. In such cases, the family or woman may want to abort the pregnancy. For this termination, pregnant women often go to untrained persons, dais etc. The methods employed by them for termination are not safe and the facilities are unhygienic. Hence, there is a great risk to the life of these women. You can educate such women with unwanted pregnancies about the dangers of these illegal, unsafe abortions. Such women should be able to confirm whether they are pregnant and if so, they can seek safe and legal abortion at a government health centre or government approved private hospital. Abortions have been legalized since 1971 under certain conditions, as given in under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (“MTP” Act). Such abortions can be carried out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy. Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks (2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to go a\n",

      "out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy. Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks (2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to go a hospital. Abortions done early in pregnancy are also safer than those carried out later. Hence, the woman should not wait till her pregnancy has advanced. PAGE 125 24 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA As per PNDT Act, 1. Detection of sex of foetus during pregnancy is illegal. 2. Termination of pregnancy after identifying the sex of the foetus as female is also illegal. There are two methods of terminating the pregnancy: Surgical abortion This is carried out by evacuating the embryo either using a hand held syringe or electric suction machine Medical abortion This is carried out by using pills In both cases, it has to be done by a qualified doctor in any approved centre. Women undergoing MTP can get more details from PHC. There are advantages/disadvantages of both methods. In both cases, there has to be post-abortal care for the women undergoing MTP. Post-abortal care  Follow up after abortion is a must especially after the tablets are given for medical abortion.  If the woman has any of the following symptoms, she should be immediately referred to the nearest functional FRU/District hospital.  Severe bleeding or foul smelling discharge from uterus  Severe pain in abdomen  Fever  Swelling in the abdomen or severe vomiting Counselling of the women will help them to seek safe abortions which will help in decreasing deaths among pregnant women. After an induced abortion, a woman can become pregnant again within six weeks. Hence, it is advisable for the woman (and her partner) to be counselled for appropriate contraception and help them to get the suitable contraceptive if they wish to adopt.It is important to remember:  Termination of pregnancy below 20 weeks is legal under provision of MTP Act.

PAGE 127 Immunization 7 Immunization is one of the most well-known and cost effective methods of preventing diseases. Though most of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) are controlled by now, immunization has to be sustained, not only to prevent VPDs, but also a) to eliminate Tetanus, b) reduce the incidence of Measles and c) eradicate Poliomyelitis. The six vaccine preventable diseases are DPT Immunization Tetanus  Poliomyelitis  Diphtheria  Pertussis (whooping cough)  Measles  Childhood tuberculosis The vaccines must be given at the right age, right dose, right interval and the full course must be completed to ensure the best possible protection to the child against these diseases. The schedule that tells us when and how many doses of each vaccine are to be given is called immunization schedule.

PAGE 130 Diarrhoea 8 Diarrhoea is defined as passage of liquid or watery stools. These watery stools are usually passed more than three times in a day. Passage of even one large watery motion among children can be labelled as diarrhoea. Normally there are three types of diarrhoea:  Acute watery diarrhoea starts suddenly and may continue for a number of days but not more than 14 days. Most of these are self-limiting and will last for three to seven days.  Dysentery is diarrhoea with visible blood in stools.  Persistent diarrhoea begins acutely but is of unusually long duration i.e. lasting more than 14 days. Diarrhoeal diseases are a major cause of death and disease among children under five years. Majority of the deaths in diarrhoea are due to dehydration (loss of water and minerals). Four golden rules to observe if a child has diarrhoea  If the child is breastfed, continue breast-feeding more frequently.  If the child has started consuming other foods, continue feeding small quantities of these items. PAGE 131 30 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA  After the child recovers and normal appetite reappears, the child may be given more food than normal to regain lost weight.  Give extra fluids  Give ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution)  Advise the mothers to give Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). You must have adequate stock of ORS, being the depot-holder, especially in the monsoon season and during any outbreak of diarrhoea.  Guide the mothers for preparing ORS.

Most children up to the age of five years are susceptible to ARI. If not treated in time some of them develop pneumonia, which can result in death. The child has some or all of the following symptoms:  Cough  Running nose  Fever  Difficulty in breathing. Serious morbidity and death are preventable if it is identified early and treated/referred in time. Care during coughs & colds  Keep the child warm.  Give plenty of fluids and continue breast-feeding.  Give home remedies – ginger, honey, lemon, kadha, etc. Respiratory Rate PAGE 134 33  Increase feeds after the child recovers.  Enough rest is to be taken by the child.  Giving immunization to children on time for vaccine preventable diseases also helps.  Timely administration of Vitamin A.  Good nutrition and avoiding exposure to cold, dust and smoke will help in preventing pneumonia. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:  Advise about feeding the child: the feeding should be continued during illness and the frequency of feeding increased after illness  Clear the nose if it interferes with feeding (use saline and a moistened wick to help soften the mucus).  Increase fluids; give the child extra fluids to drink.  Soothe the throat and relieve cough with a home remedy such as lemon with honey and ginger, tulsi, warm water etc.  Control fever using Paracetamol.  Keep the baby warm.  You should accompany the parents in taking the child to the nearest health facility if the child has any of the following danger signals:  Fast breathing.  Difficulty in breathing.  Unable to drink.  Lethargy (susti).ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION PAGE 135 Infant and Young Child Nutrition: Breastfeeding and Complementary Feeding 10 Nutrition is required for a child to grow, develop, and remain active and to reach adulthood without illness.

Nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins are required in large amounts (macro nutrients), while some nutrients e.g. Vitamins, Iron, Calcium, Iodine etc. are required in minimum amounts (micro nutrients). Growth of the child can be assessed by plotting height & weight for the age in Road to Health Chart. If the child is not growing properly, it means the child is malnourished i.e. under nourished. Nutrition in children is divided according to age as is given below: 0-6 months exclusive breastfeeding  Infants up to six months are to be exclusively breast-fed. Feed at least eight times a day.  Mothers should be encouraged to breast-feed on demand.  Bottle-feeding should be discouraged and anxious mothers should be reassured.  Breast milk is the ideal food for young infants as it contains all nutrients. PAGE 136 35 Infant and Young Child Nutrition: Breastfeeding and Complementary Feeding Chances of malnutrition in breast-fed infants are less.  It prevents infection, as it is clean and free from bacteria.  Colostrum acts as the first immunization for infants.  Breastfeeding enhances brain development  Breastfeeding increases mother and child bonding and helps in better development of the child. 6-12 months complementary feeding  Start home based complementary foods after six months four-five times a day.  Continue breastfeeding as often as the child wants.  If the child is not breastfed, it may be given undiluted milk by a cup and complementary food five times a day. Wash hands before feeding.  Food should be mashed and it should be freshly prepared. 12 months-two years  Continue breastfeeding for two years or beyond. Give home based food four-five times a day Two years onwards  Children should be given hence-cooked food five-six times a day as they eat in small quantities.  Children should be weighed every three months to assess their growth in all age groups. Malnutrition in children  A child with severe malnutrition is at risk of dying from various infectious diseases.  All children less than two years of age should be assessed and the parents should be counselled.  Additionally, children who appear weak or appear smaller for age need counselling to improve their nutrition.

The weight gain in these children should be checked at regular intervals. Feeding during illness Food intake of infants and young children decreases during illness, however the energy requirement increases. Hence, it is important to know how and when the ill child should be fed. As ASHA you should:  Advise the mothers that feeding should be continued even during illness.  Food should be given in small amounts but more frequently.  Simple home-cooked food should be given, which is easily digestible.  Advise mothers to continue breast-feeding more frequently for a few days after an episode of illness.  Advise the mothers not to dilute the dal or other foods for the baby. Take out food for the child and then add spices in the food for rest of the family. Add a spoonful of butter/ghee/oil in the baby’s food.

It is required for the normal growth and development of human beings. Its deficiency during pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion/still birth and cretinism/mental retardation in children. You should advise the pregnant women to take iodized salt in food, which is enough to prevent the iodine deficiency. PAGE 140 Fever 11 Fever is a common symptom of many diseases, which may be simple or serious. Some mild fevers subside without any treatment/treatment at home e.g. fever with no cough/running nose/ear discharge/with no rash/without diarrhoea/without any obvious infection etc. However, in many children it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness. For fever in children a blood smear examination should be done. Temperature and fever Our body is warm both in summer and winter. When it is very hot outside, our body perspires. It releases water and cools like an earthen pot. When it is very cold outside our body shivers to generate heat. In all seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all its functions.

After an attack by germs, our body works very fast. It generates more heat and hence fever. But excess fever may be harmful and lead to several complications. PAGE 141 40 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Measuring fever in adults It is wise to take a sick person’s temperature even if she/he does not mention about having fever. Touch your own forehead and the person’s forehead with both sides of your hand. If the person’s forehead is warmer than yours, she/he may have fever. This is a simple way to find out if someone has fever or not. Thermometer is used for measuring temperature  Take a simple oral thermometer and shake it well. See that its mercury mark is below normal (36°C or 98.4°F). Do not hold or touch the bulb of the thermometer. Hold the thermometer by the bigger end with no mercury because mercury line will go up and you might get a wrong reading.  Put the thermometer’s bulb end under the tongue in the patient’s mouth or armpit for two minutes.  The oral temperature is a bit higher than the armpit.  Take it out to see closely while turning it slowly.  Record the temperature of a sick person. Is it more than 36°C/98.4°F?  Temperature of 37°C–39°C is mild fever.  Between 39°C and 40°C is moderate fever.  Above 40°C it is high fever (refer any person with high fever after sponging and tablet Paracetamol).  Clean it with water after each use.  For your information, thermometers have mercury inside which is toxic and hence adequate care should be taken when used for children. Treating Fever General treatment  Mild fever generally needs no treatment unless we are thinking of some infections like malaria, TB, pneumonia etc.  For moderate fever Paracetamol tablet is the best treatment. One tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. For more details see table PAGE 142 41 on drugs in Book 1. Give tablet Paracetamol for two days. For high fever, tepid water sponging is good\n",

For high fever, tepid water sponging is good first aid, with Paracetamol tablets. If fever doesn’t come down with in two days, refer to the nearest health facility. Sponge the whole body with tepid water. Do not use cold water as it causes shivers. Do not give a blanket. Keep windows open  Give enough water and fluids to drink.  Light meals like khichadi, daal-rice, curd, dalia are soft and easily digested.  Fever is the symptom of a disease. It is not a disease in itself. Paracetamol tablet or syrup is general remedy for fever. It only brings down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not kill the causative germs. For common colds and coughs, Paracetamol or herbal remedies are good enough and no other treatment is necessary. Some home remedies for fever Home remedies soothe the effects of fever. Give her: Gulvel kadha Take a thumb thick piece of Gulvel. Add two-teaspoonful powder of dry ginger. Add 10-12 glasses of water. Boil on slow fire. When three glass full decoction remains, cool it. Give half a glass of freshly made decoction. China grass tea Tea prepared with China grass is a refreshing decoction for someone suffering from simple fever. Specific treatment for illness For illnesses due to various germs we need to give specific medicines. Malaria, pneumonia, TB, etc need specific medicines other than Paracetamol. However viral illnesses have no specific remedies. Virus is a very small germ causing many fever-illnesses. Common cold, flu, dengue, jaundice etc are viral illnesses. Remember several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g., malaria, pneumonia, pus (anywhere) typhoid, TB, kala azar, filariasis, brain fever, HIV/AIDS etc. We will learn about them. As a thumb rule, do not wait for more than two days for cure.FEVER PAGE 143 42 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Roles and responsibilities of ASHA:  Advise the mothers/families to take the child to PHC immediately if:  a child is less than two months old.  there is fever with unconsciousness/drowsiness.  there is fever with convulsions.  there\n",

You would also be learning about what advice to give to women and men who have complaints suggestive of reproductive tract infections or sexually transmitted infections. This book will also build on your information on the causes, transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS. You know very well that there are many adolescents and young boys and girls in your village. In general, they may appear to be healthy, but they need advice and counselling for developing healthy habits. They may also need health care for some of the common problems. Also in some parts of our country, marriage takes place at an early age, so that pregnancy and child-bearing happens early in their life. Hence adolescent girls need to get proper care in pregnancy and childbirth. Adolescents need to be 1 PAGE 152 8 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA told about the ill effects of early marriage and pregnancy.

Adolescents also need knoweldge and skills to promote their health and prevent diseases. This book will help you in counselling the couples and individuals about family planning and how and when to get the services. PAGE 153 Preventing Unwanted Pregnancies What is family planning? Many couples want to either limit the number of children in the family or wish to wait for some time before having children. Similarly newly married couples may like to delay having children for two to three years. There are several ways by which couples can plan their family’s size Benefits of family planning Using any family planning method for preventing pregnancies can lead to following benefits for the health of mother and children in the family. Mother  Women with four or more children have greater risk of death during childbirth.  Similarly older women have more problems during childbirth.  If adolescent girls get married early i.e. before 18 years they start having children too soon. These girls are more likely to have complications or can die during childbirth. Also children born to these mothers have low birth weight and more likely to die in the first year.2 PAGE 154 10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Children  If a woman has children too close i.e. less than 36 months interval, her own health and her children’s health suffer.  Family with fewer children will be able to take better care of them, including their educational attainments, growth and development. Other benefits  Some contraceptives i.e. condoms (both male and female condom) help in protecting against infections of genital tract including HIV/AIDS as well as preventing unwanted pregnancies.  Some methods are good to regulate irregular bleeding from uterus.  Use of family planning methods will allow women to exercise their right over their own bodies. If they do not wish to have more children then they can use contraceptives with discretion.

      "can use contraceptives with discretion. Different family planning methods Pregnancies are caused by the union of egg produced by the woman and the sperm by the man. The egg (which later grows into a baby after union with the sperm) is produced inside the womb of the woman. When a sexual union between man and woman takes place, sperms released to the vagina of woman swim toward the egg in the womb. Union of egg and one of the sperms results in pregnancy. The walls of the womb provide nourishment to the egg. The egg unites with the sperm and grows into a baby. There are five main types of family planning methods: Barrier methods If the sperm does not reach the egg, pregnancy can be avoided. For e xample, when a man uses a condom, the sperm remains inside the condom only. Therefore, the sperms are not able to reach the egg inside the womb. Thus pregnancy is prevented. ManSperm EggWomanSperm enters the egg and unites with itFetus, which grows into a babyHormonal methods This prevents the woman’s o vary from releasing an egg, make it harder for the sperm to reach the egg, and keep the lining of the womb from supporting a pregnancy. For example Mala N tablets. PAGE 155 11 PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES IUDs These are devices inserted inside the womb. They prevent the egg and s perms from fusing and also prevent implantation. Natural methods These help a woman to know when she is fertile, so that she can avoid h aving sex at that time. Permanent methods These are operations, which prevent a man or a woman to have any more children in future. Barrier methods You will be provided with condoms for distribution to women who need them. Women are shy to buy them from the market. Many do not know how to use them and where to keep them. Condoms (Nirodh)  Prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS  A new condom is to be used each time during sex  Correct and consistent use of condoms is essential to prevent unwanted pregnancies How to use condom?

Unroll condom onto erect penis before genital contact 4. Remove penis from vagina while still erect and hold onto condom5. Dispose off properly3. Be sure to unroll condom all the way to base of penis PAGE 156 12 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA What you have to do:  Advise families to use condom as a family planning method. Also explain that condoms prevent sexually transmitted infections.  Make condoms available to all those who wish to use them.  If the situation is suitable, you can show the couple how condom is used. Use a flip chart and a condom piece. Sometimes you will have to show it to the woman and ask her to share it with her husband.  Some myths and doubts about condoms need to be answered. The misconceptions are:  Condoms reduce pleasure of sex.  A condom user is an “easy” person.  If not properly used, condoms can burst during use. In that case, advise to use emergency contraceptive pills.  The female condom is now available in cities, so that even women can use a condom. That is helpful when men are unwilling to put on condoms and it empowers women in risky sex situations. Dispose off the condom properly.  Keep condoms in cool, dry place and away from sunlight.  Keep a stock of condoms and show how to use them, and make condoms available. Hormonal methods Oral contraceptive pills Oral contraceptives come in cycle packs of 28 pills. Only the first 21 of them contain hormones. The other seven pills contain iron supplements. One pill has to be taken each day. The iron supplement pills are taken after completing 21 hormone pills. Since most women are anaemic, the iron tablets are also helpful. These pills do not interrupt the sexual activity. Above all, unlike condom, OCP is a woman-controlled contraceptive method. There are several brands available PAGE 157 13 in the market. Our ANM and PHCs have supply of MALA-N. You could keep a supply of these pills. How to use\n",

You could keep a supply of these pills. How to use OC Start the pill from any of first seven days of start of menstrual bleeding and continue until the pack finishes. Start a new pack again. Taken regularly, the pill is almost 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. These pills do not cause abortion. If a woman forgets a day’s dose she should take both the missed and regular tablets together. But one must not miss it for more than two days. If missed for two days, advise her to take pills as soon as she remembers. She can continue taking the pill each day until the pack is finished and also use a condom for sex until seven hormonal pills are taken in a row. You should always mention about the common side effects of oral contraceptives such as nausea, mild headache, tenderness of breasts, spotting between periods and sometimes-irregular periods. Explain that these side effects are not signs of any serious disease. These usually become less or stop in three months. You should help women in getting examined by ANM/Medical Officer, before starting oral pills. You should give monthly supplies to women who have started oral pills after consultation with ANM/Medical Officer. Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP) Emergency contraceptive pills are pills to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. These pills are taken only in some emergency situations. These pills are especially useful for those women who have been subjected to unprotected sex, slippage or bursting of condoms during sex or sexual violence. These pills are to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sexual exposure preferably within 72 hours. These pills will also not work if the woman is already pregnant. She should take two tablets within an interval of 12 hours. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES Take the first tablet as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex.

These pills are now available at health centres and also at pharmacy shops. No prescription is needed to buy them. They are available as EC pills in the programme. Several commercial and social marketing brands are also available. ECPs, taken as per instructions, provide protection against unwanted pregnancy. Discourage repeated use of ECP and advise for choosing a contraceptive method. ECPs do not protect against infections like STI and HIV/AIDS. Copper-T This is a small T-shaped intra-uterine device (IUD). It is made of pliable plastic with fine copper wire wound around its stem. Two plastic threads hang by its stem. After insertion into the womb, Copper-T stays in place and is effective for a maximum of ten years. Some Copper-T devices available in the market are effective for shorter duration also. How does the Copper-T work? Copper-T works mainly by preventing sperms and egg from meeting. IUD makes it hard for sperm to move through the woman’s reproductive tract and reduces ability of the sperm to fertilize the egg. Possibly it also prevents implantation. What you should do:  You are a depot holder for OCPs (Mala N)  You should explain all methods to the women and help them in making choices  Start Mala N tablets after consulting with ANM/doctor that the woman is eligible for OCPs  Tell her about side effects and when/where to approach a service provider  Also provide information about ECPs and where these pills are available PAGE 159 15 Copper-T can be used  Within seven days of last menstrual period  After six weeks of child birth – This is the best time  Only trained nurses and doctors should insert Copper-T  Copper-T should be inserted only at health centres or hospitals  Women can get Copper-T removed any time on demand Copper-T is generally safe to use.

Advise women to have check-up once after one month, then after three months and then once a year. Copper-T cannot be inserted at home because stringent cleanliness is n eeded during Copper-T insertion. The woman can go home immediately a fter putting Copper-T. Women should learn how to check the presence of Copper-T. Sometimes its gets expelled out of the womb. It is easy to learn technique of feeling the nylon threads in vagina. Copper-T cannot escape the womb and go up. It can be easily removed by a nurse with a gentle pull. Some women have pain and bleeding after inserting Copper-T. It stops after few cycles. If the condition does not improve then Copper-T can be removed. There are no after-effects if Copper-T is inserted after six weeks of delivery. Removal Copper-T should be removed after 10 years or earlier if woman wishes to have a child, or when she develops heavy bleeding, lower abdominal pain, or severe backache. You should help women in getting Copper-T removed at an appropriate facility.

You should know more about standard days method from your ANM. Cervical mucus method The opening of the womb of the woman has a sticky fluid called cervical mucus. Typically the mucus is thin and sticky for two days before and after ovulation, which allows for easy passage of the sperm. This is the fertile period. In other days the mucus is thick, dry and breaks on stretching. These days are infertile. These natural methods need a lot of self-control and have a very high failure rate. Therefore it is advisable to adopt other contraceptive methods that have low failure rate in case the woman does not desire pregnancy. However, fertility awareness of a woman is desirable in case of couples with the problem of infertility to increase their chances of conception in many cases. Your responsibilities:  Talk about fertility awareness in the meetings of women’s groups.  With ovulation awareness a woman can choose to conceive or avoid conception in that cycle.

So no need to come back for stitch removal. This method is becoming popular. Now doctors are being trained in this new technique. There are less side effects of NSV as compared to conventional vasectomy. This is a safe and easy method and requires only 10-15 minutes. Men commonly think that vasectomy causes weakness — in work and sexual life. This is not true and there is no evidence about it so far. The testicles are not even touched in vasectomy. It is the testicles that secrete hormones and regulate sexual functions. Vasectomy does not affect this any way. There is a need to popularize vasectomy. Why sometimes pregnancy occurs after vasectomy? After vasectomy three months are needed to make the semen sperm-free. A condom has to be used during this period This point is often ignored by men and conception can take place. Condom use for three months after vasectomy can prevent chances of pregnancy. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES PAGE 164 20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Tubectomy (female sterilization) Tying and cutting the tubes that carry eggs (egg-tubes) is tubectomy. There are several ways of doing this procedure. In many states this operation is done using laparoscope (doorbeen). It blocks the meeting of ovum and sperms. This is a popular sterilization method in India. Two methods of tubectomy Mini-laparotomy is the conventional method This involves opening the abdomen through a small incision and operating by hand. Local anaesthesia is given by injection. The mini-lap method needs hospitalization for two days. It is useful for post-childbirth tubectomy, when the womb is still high in the abdomen and easy to reach. Laparoscopy This involves inserting a laparoscope into the abdomen and applying tight plastic rings on the tubes. Laparoscopy can only be performed when the womb returns to its normal size and position (at least six weeks after childbirth). Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail. Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later if\n",

Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later if a tube happens to reopen. In cases of major complications attributable to sterilization, failure and unlikely event of death, you should help in accessing compensation available as per FP insurance scheme. You will get more information from your ANM. Reversing sterilization (recanalization) For all practical purposes, sterilization operations are permanent procedures. But, in unusual circumstances like death of all children, recanalization to join the cut ends of tubes together can be adopted by the couple. But in both men and women, only one in four such procedures succeed. These facilities are available in big hospitals only. PAGE 165 Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) including Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)3 What are RTIs/STIs and how are they spread? Many women suffer sexual infection, including abnormal discharges through the vagina, ulcers and sores in the genital region and pelvic infections. Men also generally have sexual infections. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections of the reproductive organs that are caused by various germs. Though RTIs can occur both in men and women, they are more common in women, because their body structure and functions make it easier for germs to enter. RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Reproductive organs can also get infected because of trauma during delivery, unhygienic practices during delivery and abortions, as well as overgrowth of germs normally found in the vagina. Poor general health, poor genital hygiene and early start of sexual activity are all factors that can make women prone to these infections. Many women suffer from reproductive health problems. Women are more vulnerable to these infections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. sexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk.

      "are usually too shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers. They have been taught to silently suffer problems related to sex. There is also a fear that if a woman is found to have RTIs, especially STDs, she will be labelled a ‘loose woman’. There is a reluctance to seek medical treatment because of inadequate sex education and less access to medical care. The ‘decision-makers’ at home, like the mother-in-law, would allow a woman to be taken to a health worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems or infertility, but not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal discharge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs. RTIs have been badly neglected because they do not kill the person directly. They usually remain inside a woman’s body, giving her chronic abdominal and back pain or making her infertile. Many women keep on suffering and remain silent. Symptoms of RTIs In woman  Abnormal vaginal discharge, which has bad smell and more quantity than usual  Ulcers or sores over the external genitals  Lower abdominal pain because of pelvic infection In man  Discharge from the penis  Ulcers The presence of RTIs/STIs could also be indicated in men and women by the presence of:  Pain or bleeding during intercourse  Painful swelling in the groin  Burning pain on passing urine  Itching around the genitals Unless treated early, RTIs/STIs can lead to several complications, ranging from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility, to increased risk of HIV infections, ectopic pregnancy, cancer of the cervix and death. There can be pregnancy-related complications like premature deliveries, low PAGE 167 23 birth weight babies, stillbirths, abortions or birth defects. Newborns can also get eye infection from the mother’s birth canal, eventually leading to blindness and pneumonia. Abnormal vaginal discharge Usually discharge can be normal if it is for short time and without other symptoms like itching or pain.

Many infections of reproductive tract in women show as foul smelling or bloody-yellow, greenish or curdy discharge. Causes of abnormal vaginal discharge  Lack of genital hygiene, especially during menstruation can facilitate infections.  Use of unclean instruments during delivery, abortions by unauthorized providers.  Sex without condoms especially when partner is suffering from some infections. It is important to remember that these infections are easily preventable and curable. Preventing infections  Advise women and families to have deliveries in hospitals only.  Deliveries should be conducted by skilled persons only.  Abortions at registered hospitals only.  Maintenance of genital hygiene during menstruation.  Avoiding unsafe sex by use of condoms - women can’t always insist on condom use by partner. They need to learn negotiation skills for condom use. Availability of female condoms may also save women in such situations.  Women should be encouraged to seek treatment from qualified providers. You can help women get services by going with them to PHC/hospital in city. Women generally feel shy and awkward to talk about it.  Complete treatment as advised by a qualified doctor is a must.

Women are more affected by HIV/AIDS in India as this is directly related to her economic and social status and gender inequalities. The existing social and gender norms have great impact on sexual activity and risk behaviour of men and women, which affect women more than men. Women also find it difficult to motivate their partners to use condoms or approach services for treatment of infections. In our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place through the sexual route. There are no “high risk groups” but there are some people who have high-risk behaviour. HIV/AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour. The window period After exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12 weeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period to get an HIV test done. AIDS is the disease AIDS may occur many years after getting HIV positive, but the person is infected during this period. AIDS is a serious disease without permanent cure, though we have some medicines to reduce its severity. Suggestive symptoms of AIDS:  Continuous weight loss.  Persisting diarrhoea.  Repeated fever or illness lasting more than one month.  The minor features include chronic cough, itching, rash on body and genitals, oral thrush (fungal infection), bubos, and illnesses coming too often.

When breasts start to develop, one may notice small, tender lumps under one or both nipples that will get bigger over the next few years. When breasts first begin to develop, it is not unusual for one breast to be larger than the other. However, as they develop, they will be alike in size and shape. Hair: Soft hair will start to grow in the p ubic area (the area between legs). This hair will eventually become thick and very curly. Hair grows under the arms and on the legs. Body shape: Hips get wider and waist w ill get smaller. Body will also begin to build up fat in the stomach, buttocks, and legs. This is normal and gives body the curves of a woman. Body size: Arms, legs, hands, and feet m ay grow faster than the rest of the body. Skin: Skin may get more oily. This is b ecause glands are growing too.

PAGE 175 Helping Adolescent Girls to Take Care of Themselves during Menstruation6 Staying clean Generally girls living in small towns and cities use sanitary pads for protection during menstrual period, if they can afford them. These are readymade soft cotton pads worn inside the underwear to catch the blood as it leaves the vagina. These pads should not be reused. Some girls prefer to make their own pads out of folded cloth or wads of cotton. These pads must always be clean and dry when worn. They should be changed several times a day and disposed of by burning outdoors in a large empty tin. If cloth is used, they should be washed well with soap and water and dried in the sun. Sun light is the cheapest disinfectant available in nature. In villages there are certain restrictions imposed on adolescents during menstruation. Those restrictions (Don’ts), which are harmful should be discouraged, such as not taking bath during menstruation or not doing any physical work. It is advisable to wash outer genitals well with water every day to remove any blood that is left.

When this happens, the body makes less hormone, which can cause changes in how often and how much a woman bleeds. Girls whose monthly bleeding has just begun – or women who have recently stopped breastfeeding – may bleed only every few months, or have very little or too much bleeding. Their cycles usually become more regular with time. Women using hormonal family planning, sometimes have bleeding in the middle of the month. Older women who have not yet gone through menopause may have heavier bleeding or bleed more often than when they were younger.

      "they may stop having monthly bleeding for a few months and then have it again. Pain with monthly bleeding During monthly bleeding the womb squeezes in order to push out the lining. The squeezing can cause pain in the lower belly or lower back, sometimes called cramps. The pain may begin before bleeding starts or just after it starts. Tips for taking care  Do exercise, walk and run  Rub your lower belly. This helps the tight muscles to relax.  Fill a plastic bottle or some other container with hot water and place it on your lower belly or lower back. Or, use a thick cloth you have soaked in hot water.  Drink tea with ginger. Women in your community may know of other remedies that work for this kind of pain.  Take a mild medicine for pain with doctor’s advice. Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) Some women and girls feel uncomfortable one or two weeks before their monthly bleeding begins. They may have one or more of a group of signs that are known as pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). Women who have PMS may notice:  Sore breasts  A full feeling in the lower belly  Constipation (when you cannot pass stool)  Feeling extra tired PAGE 177 33  Sore muscles, especially in the lower back or belly  A change in the wetness of the vagina  Oiliness or spots (pimples) on the face  Feelings that are especially strong or hard to control  Craving for certain foods and increased hunger and thirst. Many women have at least one of these signs each month and some women may have all of them. A woman may have different signs from one month to the next. For many women, the days before the start of their bleeding is a time of unrest. But some women say they feel more creative and able to get things done. These symptoms disappear within a few days after the start of the menstrual period. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: Advise to  Eat less salt. Salt makes the body to keep extra water inside, which gives the full feeling in the womb.  Try to avoid caffeine (found in coffee, tea and some soft drinks\n",

Book number 4 provides you necessary information in helping people access services available in the various National Health Programmes. In the past, programmes have suffered due to lack of community participation. It is envisaged that information available in this book will facilitate in organizing community action to achieve various National Health Programme objectives. India has a rich tradition of indigenous system of medicines e.g., Ayurveda and local health practices. Many people prefer to access and utilize services available from such providers. You will also learn about some of PAGE 187 8 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA the remedies available in Ayurveda, Unani and Homoeopathy systems of medicine in this book. This will help you to guide people who desire to undergo treatment as per preference for the particular therapy. PAGE 188 Tuberculosis2 Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It occurs commonly in lungs but can occur in different parts of our body i.e. intestines, kidneys, bones etc. There may be about 15 to 25 confirmed cases of TB in your village. Please ensure that all of them are identified and registered for treatment. Lung TB spreads by air. When a patient of TB coughs or sneezes, the bacteria enters the body of other persons who breathe that air. However, TB can spread to other parts of the body too.

But, whoever has the above symptoms should be suspected of having TB. Vulnerable situations  People with malnutrition  People living in crowded areas like slums etc.  People living in houses without proper ventilation  People living in environmentally polluted areas  People with HIV/AIDS  Women and children are equally vulnerable Generally, all the poor are vulnerable as they have the maximum chances to fall into the above categories. Under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the following services are available:  Sputum of person having cough for more than three weeks is examined three times in Microscopy centres. You should know the nearest microscopy centre. You may ask the ANM where they are so that you could guide a person to these places for sputum testing.  If sputum examination shows evidence of TB, anti- TB drugs are initiated. Duration of treatment would be as per doctor’s advice ranging from six months to nine months.  In some cases, X-ray may be necessary and if it is positive, anti-TB drugs are given. Anti TB drugs are available at all district TB centres, TB clinics, government hospitals, district hospitals, Haemoptysis three samples of Sputum Sputum Examination X-Ray PAGE 190 11 TUBERCULOSIS CHCs, PHCs etc. Again you could check with the ANM for treatment of TB.

With bleeding. Any wound requires immediate care. Following steps should be taken for wound care  First clean the wound and the surrounding area with clean water. Use different cotton swabs for each cleaning.  Wipe away the dirt with cotton gently, but do not rub it. Rubbing disturbs the clot and it can start bleeding again.  Make a rectangular pad using cotton between two layers of gauze. The diagonal of the rectangle should be one inch longer than the wound itself. Ask your trainer to teach you to make this.  If the wound is dry, then it need not be opened.  For sharp cuts, stitches may be needed. Usually simple stitching of small injuries can be done at nearby health facility. Such persons need to be sent to health facility.4 Wound Care PAGE 196 17  It is advised that all persons with wounds be given\n",

Sometimes you may need to control bleeding  First, stop the bleeding. Press the wound with gauze or a clean cloth if the bleeding doesn’t stop.  Clean the wound with cotton balls soaked in clean water. Cotton swabs should be just about wet. If you have no cotton, soft clean cotton cloth from sari or dhoti will do.  If there is continuous bleeding from the wound then immediately refer to the nearest health facility. Using local and home remedies We have very good home remedies for wound care.  Application of ice on bleeding wound until the bleeding stops.  Haldi in oil is an excellent anti-septic. For abrasions and small cuts, application is enough. Dressing is not required in such cases.  Aloe is a good wound healer and a natural dressing too. Cut a piece of aloe across its length and of the wound size. Put the raw cut side of aloe and tie it on the wound with cloth. Replace aloe dressing everyday.  Application of neem oil is a good substitute. For bigger wounds, you may put it on the dressing pad.  Raw papaya pieces can be an effective dressing. This is especially good for infected wounds.  Triphala powder pressed on the wound stops small bleeds and also works as an antiseptic. You can wash the wounds also with Triphala kadha. Your role and responsibilities :  To stop bleeding by application of pressure on the wound.  Refer all patients with continuous bleeding for stitches to nearest health facility.WOUND CARE PAGE 197 Dog and animal bites: Will it be rabies?

      "a deadly illness, which is called rabies. This is an illness, which affects the brain. The victim fears water. This is due to severe spasm during swallowing. No cure is available for rabies. Anti Ra bies Va ccine (ARV) immediately after the dog bite can prevent the fatal illness. These vaccines are available in government hospitals. Not all dogs are rabid. Germs are present in the saliva of infected dogs. Some dogs get the infection from wild animals such as wolf or tiger. The infected dog passes it on to the other dogs. All infected animals finally die and may infect others in the meantime. Controlling stray dogs is the key to prevent rabies. Monkeys and other animals can also be infectious if they are rabid due to such bites. Very effective and simple first aid for any dog bite is to:  Wash the wound with soap and water thoroughly. This is most important.  Do not disturb the wound. Leave it open. Tie a loose dressing and advise to consult doctor/other staff in hospital. 5 Dog and Other Animal Bites PAGE 198 19 How dangerous is the bite? People will ask you if the bite is dangerous. A bite can cause illness only if the animal itself is infected. First symptoms of rabies in bitten person may appear early within 10 days or more after the bite. Rabies infection is likely if a pet dog dies within 10 days of the bite or if it shows any signs of rabies. Even a scratch on the skin may give rabies infection. Each wound is important. We can decide the risk of exposure as follows: Mild: Licks on normal skin, scratches without blood, drinking raw milk of s uspect cattle. Moderate: Licks on fresh cuts, scratches with blood oozing, minor wounds f ewer than five, all wounds except those on face, neck, head, palms and fingers. Severe: All bites and scratches with oozing blood on neck, face, palms, f ingers, face and head, Lacerated wounds on any part of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals. If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe. Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The\n",

      "of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals. If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe. Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The effect of ARV reduces after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite, fresh vaccination is necessary. Rabies in dogs: Abnormal behaviour Identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. Remember that there are two types of rabid dogs - the aggressive and the silent. The aggressive DOG AND OTHER ANIMAL BITES PAGE 199 20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA kind keep biting and attacking humans and animals. They may refuse feeds but bite at wood or iron objects. They look ferocious. There is profuse salivation. Usually rabid animals act strangely. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes restless or irritable or attacking. Their mouth dribbles and froths and this fluid is highly infectious. An originally aggressive dog may turn docile. The silent type languishes to death in neglected places. Wild animals may look friendly and turn to habitations. In case there are such problems in your area these need to be addressed and Gram Panchayats have to play the key role. Immunizing dogs Immunization of dogs is essential. The protection given by vaccines used in the government veterinary services lasts for six months. Protection by newer vaccines lasts for one year. Those who handle dogs also need immunization every six months. A common problem is whether to use the milk of an animal bitten by a suspected dog or animal. The rabies germ is not reported in the milk of animals. It is completely destroyed by boiling, so milk of such animals is not harmful. However, the saliva of the animal will contain germs if infected by rabies. The key issue is to avoid direct contact of saliva of such animals. Your role and responsibilities :  Wash the site of bite with soap and water thoroughly.  Refer all cases of dog/other animal bites to facility where an anti-rabies vaccine is available.  Advise people to get pet dogs vaccinated against rabies.

In some cases, the pressure stove is the culprit. In others it can be gas leak from the cylinder. Children or women may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids — like milk, oil, dal, chai etc. Please note that some of the burn cases can be suicide attempts or attempt to murder. In any case, our priority should be to give first aid and take the person to hospital at the earliest. Inform the doctor about any information by the woman on the burn injury being intentional. In case, you know, do let her know about NGOs or counsellors she can approach for help. As necessary, the doctors will initiate legal measures in these cases. Burns: First Aid6 Common causes  Kitchen accidents – commonly bursting of pressure stoves  Fire crackers  Explosion in work places  House fires PAGE 201 22 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA  Chemical burns  Electric burns  Suicide attempts  Murder attempts First aid and other help First try to put out the flames. The immediate first aid for all kinds of burns is to pour plenty of cold water on the affected part, except on acid burns. This helps to reduce damage by absorbing heat from the skin. It also reduces pain to some extent. Water also helps by separating burning clothes from the skin. Many people wrongly believe that water causes blisters on the skin and instead they wrap the victim in blankets. This puts the fire off after some seconds, but does not absorb the heat. Water is far more effective than a blanket because it cools instantly. If you are using water-soaked folds of clothes, place them on the burnt part and change them every three minutes. Help the victim to drink as much water as possible. This helps to overcome the shock caused by fluid loss from the body. Cover the burns with a clean cloth to protect from dust, flies, etc. Unless the burns are minor, all burn cases must be referred to hospitals. Facial burns and burn in hands should be referred.\n",

Use of green leafy vegetables like spinach, Punarnnava , Sigru and fruits like Amalki , Dadim , dry grapes etc. in daily diet is important to prevent blood deficiency. ‘Mandookparni’ fried in ghee is also indicated to increase the RBC. Therapeutically, use of ‘Punarnnavadi mandura’ with water or buttermilk is indicated for minor and moderate anaemia. Anaemia in girls is a common cause for amenorrhoea. Therapeutically use of ‘Rajapravartini Vati’ 500mg. two tabs per day upto the onset of menstruation is beneficial in the condition. Three gms. powder of equal quantity of black tila (sesame), Shunti and ghritakumari (aloe) and one gm. jaggery with tepid water twice a day or decoction of above drugs including jaggery in the dose of 10-20 ml. twice a day is indicated for scanty menstruation.

Homoeopathic medicines improve absorption and thereby help in iron intake as supplement or from food rich in iron. Commonly used 7 AYUSH PAGE 204 25 homoeopathic medicines for iron deficiency anaemia are given below with their indications.  Arsenic album: Anaemia due to malaria, excessive prostration, oedema, violent and irregular palpitation.  Calcarea carbonicum: Palpitation & tachycardia, vertigo, anorexia, nausea, eructation; Pale, weak fatigue, lassitude, easily tired; Headache and heaviness at morning, profuse sweating on head.  China: Chief remedy for anaemia resulting from loss of fluids, as in lactation or haemorrhage, or from all exhausting discharges, such as menstrual flow, long-lasting diarrhoea.  Ferrum metallicum: Paleness of the face and puffiness of the extremities, weakness, easily exhausted.  Ferrum phosphoricum: Anaemia and chlorosis; it removes the underlying dyscrasia giving rise to the anaemic or chlorotic conditions and cures the trouble.  Kali carbonicum: Anaemia after loss of fluid or vitality; Pallor; Aversion to be alone; Backache, weakness, profuse menses, irregular with clots, weak before menstruation; Backache; Vertigo.  Natrum muriaticum: Anaemic and debilitated conditions due to loss of fluids, especially in women who suffer from menstrual disorders.  Phosphorus: Anaemia; Morning diarrhoea; Restlessness; Weakness and prostration; Nervousness, debility and trembling; Nausea and vomiting.  Pulsatilla: Anaemic condition produced by large or continued doses of iron; System is relaxed and worn out; Patient suffering from gastric and menstrual derangements. Some Unani medicines are also commonly used for supplementing iron in pregnant ladies, mothers and children. Sharbat-e-Faulad 15ml. twice daily is indicated for pregnant ladies and mothers. In children the medicine could be given in the dose of 5 ml. twice daily. Qurs-e-Damvi two tablets with butter is also useful for this purpose. Iron deficiency disorders can be managed as well as prevented by a proper intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.AYUSH PAGE 205 26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Iron rich foods\n",

Intake of tea, coffee and other preservatives in the food interfere in the absorption of iron. So by avoiding all the beverages, we can enhance the iron absorption. Diseases of gastro-intestinal system Gastro-intestinal system plays an important role in the normal and abnormal states of health. Ayurveda describe that the use of wholesome diet is the only factor that promotes the healthy growth of man. Food should be taken at proper time, when the body feels light after the digestion of previous meals, after the clearance of bowels and urine and when the mind is free from worries. Clean and hygienic food should be taken in optimum quantity. The food should not be too hot or too cold, too heavy or too light. Diseases of the gastro-intestinal system are primarily caused by the food and water that we take. The root causes of many chronic diseases are also related to factors derived from partially digested or undigested food materials. Therefore, the disorders arising from gastro-intestinal tract should be promptly managed. If digestive capacity is low simple remedies like ‘Trikatu’ and ‘Panchakola’ powders 2 gms.twice daily are indicated for use along with warm water before meals. In abdominal pain due to indigestion, Hinguvachadi Churna, Lashunadi Vati, Chitrakadi Vati etc. is indicated in the dose of two tablets twice daily with warm water. Constipation is a common symptom of many illnesses, which can be managed by powder of ‘Triphala’ (equal quantity of fruits of amla, harada and baheda) 5 gms. with tepid water at bedtime. 8-10 dried grapes of bigger variety boiled with about 250 ml. of milk is also indicated at bedtime for relieving constipation. Unani medicines are widely used for the management of abdominal distension and gastritis. Qurs-e-Tankar or Qurs-e-Kabid is indicated one tablet twice daily in this condition.

Asana helps to strengthen the weak abdominal muscles and improves the function of the digestive system. Kriyas, the cleansing process, eliminates the toxins and waste materials from the GIT. Rational drugs Ayurveda explains the therapeutics as basically two kinds – one kind is promotive of vigour in the healthy; the other, destructive of the disease in the ailing. A drug while inducing therapeutic effect, should not evoke untoward effects. In this regard, herbal drugs like Ashwagandha, Shatavari, Guduchi, Vasaka, Hareetaki, Amalki, Vibheetaki, Ginger etc. could be considered as safe drugs.

Theprocess of knowing oneself is continuous and we need to review our strengthsand limitations from time to time, which will help us to change. We need toconstantly grow in our capacities in order to ensure that we are able tofacilitate the process of development and empowerment at the community level too. However before we attempt to empower the community we need to know whether we are empowered ourselves. Remember we were created by nature with a unique body, soul and mind. All human beings have different characteristics and personalities. The externalenvironment influences our personality. As women, directly or indirectly, weare told that ours is a subordinate role. We usually do not question this kind of attitude towards us. In fact, we are not trained to question the daily inequality that we face. We accept the social norms without any questioning.A woman who questions them, is viewed as “out of control.” Let us understand how this attitude affects our personality. In our Indian society a woman is identified by her relationship with others, like that of adaughter, mother, wife, etc. Being brought up in a patriarchal society, a woman internalises these norms, which makes her devalue herself. She does not think of herself as worthwhile and neglects all her needs. All this affectsher self-esteem and overall personality. PAGE 218 6As a woman you must have experienced that you are expected to be humble, to put your needs after that of other people, to learn to say “yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval. This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your journey as an ASHA you\n",

      "“yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval. This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your journey as an ASHA you need to first identify your own needs in order to be able to understand and appreciate the needs of others. Let Us Understand the Meaning of Self-Esteem Self-esteem refers to the perception that you have about yourself. It is about how much you value yourself and how important you think you are. zIt is about being confident about and satisfied with your own self. zIt is about a reasonable sense of your self-worth. zIt is about having faith in yourself and your abilities. zIt is about being pleased with yourself and with your achievements. Remember, it is NOT about zConvincing yourself that you are of value zFeeling confident or feeling good when other people praise you zHaving beautiful features Let us examine the characteristics of a person with healthy self-esteem: zSelf-confidence zAbility to express true feelings zAbility to recognise and value own accomplishments zAbility to forgive self and others zAbility to welcome change If you do not take care of yourself, respect who you are and respect your own needs, you will not be able to take care of others and respect their needs. Give some time to know yourself. There is a need to go through the process of self-realisation. It will help you to build up a healthy self-esteem. Maintain a diary about your dealing with others and yourself during the day.The process of understanding the self and self-realisation is continuos and one needs to do it systematically. PAGE 219 7Think about the following questions. Answering them will help you in self- reflection. More questions may be added. zWhat are some of the difficulties that I face in order to complete my work? zWhat are some of the changes which I will practice if I have to deal with this situation again? (The changes can be related to behaviour, way of working, etc.) zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? zWhat did I do today which has made me happy?

      "way of working, etc.) zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? zWhat did I do today which has made me happy? Remember , each day must contribute to your overall goals in some way. Each day must in some way be connected to the rest of your life. Each day shouldcontribute to your general welfare, happiness and empowerment. This will also contribute to the development of your community. We have 24 hours in a day, out of which we spend about seven hours sleeping. Out of the remaining17 hours, we need to think about how many we actually spend on self-development. As an ASHA we suggest that you initially need atleast half anhour everyday for yourself in order to grow and develop. You may increasethis period as you get more familiar with this practice. We need to plan for our self-development from today. You may use the tools given here for help.

List them in order of priority 1 23 How will I improve myself? What difficulties do I foresee while implementing my plan?How will I overcome these difficulties? Whose support will I require? How will I monitor my self-development plan?Suggestions for monitoring my self-development plan:Review your daily performance as you close the day. Note the efforts you made for self-development as per your plan. If you have not been able todo it, think about the reasons. Reflect on what you will do differently so that you do not come up with these reasons again. Try to maintain a diary and write down the important steps that you have taken to develop yourself, what difficulties you faced and how youovercame them. You may share your self-development plan with a person whom you trust. You may take regular feedback from that person to learn whether she/he has noticed the changes in you. Note: Once you achieve what you had planned, develop a new plan and follow the same steps . PAGE 221 9Some Tips to Achieve your Goal zBe passionate about your goal.

Topskills will let you achieve your final goal. Make sure that you are growingday-by-day, month-by-month, year-by-year. You can always learn new things. Even if you only improve a little at the beginning it will keep accumulating and eventually become a large amount! zAs an ASHA, demand the best from yourself and from others. Unlike a common person, an excellent person makes great demands on herself/himself. zAs an ASHA you are unique.You are talented and skilled and, therefore, you have been selected to serve the community. Make maximum use of your potential and make sure that you achieve your goals. You need to have astrong will. A strong WILL can move mountains. PAGE 222 10 ASHA as a Health Activist Your role as an activist to improve the access of marginalised and disadvantaged community members to public health care services is very important. Before we discuss your role in detail, let us visualise a situation. Rami lives next to your house. She is five months pregnant. She is very weak, but has not registered her name with the ANM. Rami does not receive any healthcare services. Her husband is a drunkard. Everyday he drinks and shouts at Rami, sometimes even beats her. You feel uncomfortable and want to stop this. You discuss this with other women in your neighbourhood. They understand your point of view. Together you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectivelygo and stop him. You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens again, you\n",

You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens again, you would inform the police. Next day when the ANM (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife) comes, you take Rami with you and register her name. Well, admittedly a real situation does not get handled this smoothly, but you will never know just how it will fare unless you try it out. You need to take the first step towards bringing about change. Initially you will be alone but slowly, with your efforts of creating awareness through one-to-one approachor by addressing the issue in the village meetings you will have many to support you in your endeavour. PAGE 223 11The above effort is an example to explain “activism” As an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist. So it is important to understand how it is done. Read the following real life examples ofactivism. Anti Arrack Movement In 1991, women from Dubagunta, Nellore district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, drove away the liquor contractors from their village. This is said to have been the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor)Movement, which finally led to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on16 January 1995. The main participants in the early struggle were poor rural women, predominantly from scheduled castes and backward classes, supported by voluntary organisations and, later, by politicians from opposition parties. This is not just a story, it actually happened. It is about what a miracle that common women were able to achieve collectively. It is about a communityof hard-working women who laboured in the fields to earn their living.Unfortunately, all their labour was wasted on arrack and toddy (locallymade liquor). The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the hard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), inexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris.

      "liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris. After drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making their lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to gostraight to these shops in the evening after returning from work. Theycame home late at night, completely drunk.They would hand over somemoney for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his father to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community was embarrassed when her relatives visited her houseand, to her shame, were scared away from the village by the obscenelanguage of her closest neighbor, a heavy drinker. She felt ashamed andthought that the village would be a much better place without arrack. Everyday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women discussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached the village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders.They expressed their problem and asked them to get r emove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the Sarpanch, although agree able, were unable to do anything PAGE 224 12The next day one hundred of the women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come intothe village’, they told the cart driver strongly in unison and stood in frontof it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them offered him a rupee to doso.The driver got scared and left the village. Then a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded that it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police were called. They said that all those who bid at auctions have theright to sell arrack.The women stood unmoved. They said that they wouldgo to the Collector and will not keep quiet if arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet.

      "arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet. They made several plans, butnothing worked and they gave up. These events gave strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and struggled strongly to get rid of arrack from theirvillage. The story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of the district. In the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the community through puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They also shared the story of Dubagunta village. Women of other villages had also suffered a lot. There were quarrels every day in their families.They survived only by taking refuge in neighbouringhouses. Daily, for two-three hours they had to put up with this situation.There was not enough food for their children. So, women in other villages considered doing in their village what the women in Dubagunta had done earlier. The members of three literacy centres discussed this issue. Theteachers supported and guided them. Finally, they also attacked the arrackshops. They too managed to stop the arrack business in their village.The women in Dubagunta initiated and led a movement in which women from other villages joined and ultimately the situation changed for the better. Chipko Movement The Chipko Movement was initiated in the Uttarakhand region of India by a group of villagers who opposed the commercial cutting down of trees. Themovement was led by women who were influenced by Mahatma Gandhi. For rural women, saving the environment is crucial to their economic survival. As primary food, fuel and water gatherers, women have strong interests in reversing deforestation, desertification and water pollution.The women made a living in the Himalayan foothills, using its forests assources of food and fuel. They faced a particularly severe challenge in the PAGE 225 131960s, when India, to enhance economic development, started to cut trees to export the wood and earn foreign exchange. As a consequence, the hillsoil washed away, causing landslides, floods and silting in the rivers belowthe hills. Crops and houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies.

      "houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies. Against these harmful deforestation policies a movement called Chipko was born. “Chipko” in Hindi means to cling, reflecting the protesters’ maintechnique of throwing their arms around the tree trunks marked to be cut,and refusing to move. In a remote hill town a contractor had been giventhe right by the state to fell 3000 trees for a sporting goods store. The areawas already becoming barren. The women of the village decided to fight against this. When the woodcutters were scheduled to arrive, the men were lured away from the village leaving the women at home, busy withhousehold work. As soon as the woodcutters appeared, the alarm wassounded and the village's female leader, a widow in her 50s, collected 27women and rushed to the forest. The women pleaded with the woodcuttercalling the forest their “maternal home” and explaining the consequences of felling trees. The woodcutters shouted at and abused the women and threatened them with guns. The women in turn threatened to hug themarked trees and die with them. It worked! The frightened labourers leftand the contractor backed off. In 1974, women in a nearby area used thesame tree-hugging technique in order to protest against the clearing oftheir forestlands. Similarly, in your community you may come across several issues that require to be addressed. For example, the anganwadi is not functioning well; childrenand women are not receiving their entitlement of supplementary food; themidday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly. It could be thatwidow pension is not being received in spite of all the required formalitiesbeing completed by the widows of the village. So, to bring change in such situations, some collective action is required. However, activism or protest is not the first step in any process towards change. First, one needs to understand the situation and find out if thingscan be changed through simply drawing the attention of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue. For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter in order to resolve it.\n",

      "of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue. For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter in order to resolve it. Activism may not always be the best method of changing the world but it can be quite useful under the right circumstances. It gives voice to a cause. Activism is particularly useful/effective when you have many people who are affected with the same issues and the situation needs to be changed. If you PAGE 226 14decide to initiate a movement along with the people to change a situation, first see if there is some organisation or institute working on the same issueand try and seek their support or join them in their efforts. As an ASHA there are Some Key Principles that You Need to Keep in Mind in Activism to Bring about Change 1. Identify and work on the issues that are most crucial and urgent and are affecting the larger community. 2. Involve the people who are affected and ensure that they cooperate with you. 3. Let it be a people’s movement and struggle rather than an individual effort4. Mobilising the community takes time and will be energy consuming. Do not lose patience and hope. PAGE 227 15 Values of ASHA For every individual, values are the central guiding force for all behaviour and attitudes. Culture, experience, education, religion, law, language and media influence values. It is also important to know that values can change. Whileworking on social issues, we are basically working with the attitudes andbehaviours of the community and the programme implementors for a positiveand desired change. Hence, it becomes very important to address the valuesof individuals for social development. Every individual has her/his own values. There is noth ing like right or wrong. Generally, they are received from our parents, our society and oursurroundings. Values shape our personality and identity and are directly connected with our vision of life. They guide us to decide our goal and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are\n",

      "and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are lost and confused. For example, whether to spend time in gossiping or in my work will depend on myvalues. Values remain in the subconscious mind and act like red and green traffic lights.They tell us what we should or should not do. Values are a set of beliefsabout what is good and desirable. They are based on assumptions about how the world works. Our idea of what is the right thing to do in a situation comes from these values. PAGE 228 16Some examples of values which are required for social development include: 1. Value of Equality zIn a patriarchal society women are viewed as submissive, weak and soft and men as strong and powerful. Due to this thinking men are given morerecognition, power and respect in the family and society whereas womenare usually viewed in a supportive role. As a result, girls and woman haveless access to resources. For example, girls and women are given less food than boys and men of the family. Men and boys are given more scope to develop themselves, e.g., men are given more opportunity for basic and higher education. Men, usually inherit the properties of the family, while women usually do not get a share. If you believe in patriarchal values you will not see anything wrong if a woman is ill-treated. If you believe in equality you will respect a woman as a person. zIn our society the structure of caste is very strong and people who arefrom a socially advantaged class are in favour of maintaining status quo.Due to the caste structure, certain people of our society do not getopportunities to develop and get the benefits of the mainstream. As an ASHA we have to first understand problems of the poor and marginalised communities. They need to be educated about their rights andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion. 2. Value of Responsibility zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own\n",

      "andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion. 2. Value of Responsibility zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own health and that of your family and community. You may keep your own house clean and throw garbage in the street, which is not responsible behaviour. As a member of the community you need to throw garbage at the designated place so as to prevent infectious diseases. zThe Sarpanch of your village has the power to make decision for thedevelopment of your village. Many times people misuse this power and use it for their own benefit or benefit of their friends, relatives and/or caste.Being responsible for your own self and to the power you are designated with is very important. No system works effectively if all the designated members do not perform their duties effectively and in a coordinated manner. 3. Believe in People’s Knowledge and Experience All people have experience and knowledge. It needs to be respected and valued while making any decision. Never view people as empty vessels needing PAGE 229 17to be filled with knowledge. They should not be viewed as passive recipients. They need to be active in sharing their views while making decisions. Forexample, if pregnant women are not coming forward to get their namesregistered you will need to find out why they are not coming. Ask them tosuggest strategies to increase registration of pregnant women and how theycould contribute to making the strategy work. 4. Values of Trust When people honour each other, there is a trust established that leads tosynergy, interdependence and mutual respect. Gaining the trust of thosearound you is not a difficult or unachievable task. Trust can be created bysharing feelings, thoughts, views and being transparent. Trust is a glue thatholds people together. Some of the values promoted by Mahatma Gandhi zAlways speak the truth zBelieve in the power of non-violence zA person should not be discriminated against on the basis of her or his caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being. zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness. zNever misuse common resources\n",

      "her or his caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being. zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness. zNever misuse common resources like land, water, forests, wood, etc. Itbelongs to every individual on earth and all should have equal access tothese resources. zYou can touch the heart of people if you are committed to serve them. zKeep people at the centre of your activities and believe in the power ofpeople. It is a fact that people who are conscious of their value-based priorities are more fulfilled and happier in their lives. They make more effective decisionsabout their own and their family and community’s growth and development.To know your personal values is to be more aware of who you are, what you want and what you don’t want. As an ASHA, your work is very important. With that you should also value your family and community. You also need to think about what is more importantto you and why. Answering these questions for yourself can be revealing. Insome situations the family may be important and in some it may be thework. One is actually a means to another. Working together may enable you to support your family, providing you an opportunity to develop. Having a family may provide support to your work. Understanding your values enablesyou to move ahead and maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.

Usually we do not come across information on this topic.Also, in the past you may not have discussed this topic with others. As anASHA you need to know about rights. It will help you to learn about your andyour community’s rights. It will also help you to take appropriate decisions forthe development of your community.

      "We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make theinformation simple, interesting and relevant. Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not respect you. These include things people may have said about you to makeyou feel stupid or silly. For example, some one may have told you, “There is no use talking to you, you will not understand.” Try and remember one or two such hurtful statements/incidents. In 1948, after the global suffering in World War II, all the countries in the world agreed that it would be a more peaceful world if every human beingrespected the dignity of every other human being. As a result, the UniversalHuman Right Declaration came in existence. Our country has also agreed to this Declaration. PAGE 231 19This the set of the Universal Human Rights. zAll human beings are born free and equal. zEveryone should have the same rights and freedom, no matter of what race, sex, or colour she or he may be. It should not matter where wewere born, what language we speak or what religion or political opinions we have, or whether we are rich or poor. zEveryone has the right to live, to be free and to feel safe. zAdult men and women have the right to marry and start a family, without anyone trying to stop them because of their race, country or religion.Both have to agree to the marriage and both have equal rights in getting married, during the marriage, and if and when they decide to end it. zYou may believe what you want to believe, have ideas about right and wrong, and believe in any religion you want, and you may change yourreligion if you want, without interference. The entire list of Human Rights is long and we shall not be discussing it here. Let us now understand what are the Fundamental Rights. The Fundamental Rights As an Indian, our county has granted us six Fundamental Rights.

      "Freedom zRight against Exploitation zRight to Freedom of Religion zCultural and Educational Rights zRight to Constitutional Remedies Let us understand these rights in detail. The Right to Equality The state cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of race, caste, sex, religion or place of birth. The state also cannot discriminate againstanyone in matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs.But the Right to Equality specifies certain expectations. The Constitution has a special provision in the form of reserve posts while guaranteeing the Right to Equality. Reserved posts are provided for scheduled castes, scheduled tribesand other backward classes. Similarly, special provisions are provided forwomen and children. The main reason for having these exceptions is that in our society various kinds of inequalities still exist. You must have noticed how people become victims of unequal treatment. Extending such protections does not contradict PAGE 232 20the spirit of the Right to Equality. Such a policy is known as ‘Positive Discrimination’ or a ‘Protective Discrimination’ policy. Right to Freedom The Right to Freedom is a cluster of the following six freedoms: Freedom of speech and expression Freedom to assemble peacefully and without armsFreedom to form associations or unions Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India Freedom to live and settle in any part of IndiaFreedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The aim of the Right to Freedom is the development of a person. She/he should enjoy her/his rights democratically, and She/he should be able to live a healthy and civic life. This right is very crucial for democracy. Right Against Exploitation When we accept everyone as human, we cannot treat anyone as a ‘slave’. She/he cannot be kept in captivity. She/he cannot be forced into labour.Citizens are protected against such exploitation by the law. Earlier there waspractice of bonded or forced labour. Sometimes such traditions were carriedon for generations. The forced labour system has now been abolished. Practice of this system is a crime which is punishable by law. In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and\n",

      "law. In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and is a crime under the Abolition ofChild Labour Act. Right to Freedom of Religion The Right to freedom of religion provides religious freedom to all the citizens of India. All religions are equal before the state and no religion can be given preference over the other by the state. However, religious freedom also has to be observed under certain limitations. The state can regulate the non-religious activities of any religious communityin the interest of public order, morality and health. Cultural and Educational Rights India is a country of multiple religions, languages and cultures. Any community which has a language and script of its own, has the right to conserve and develop them. All minorities, religious or linguistic groups, can set up their PAGE 233 21own educational institutions. In doing so, they may preserve and develop their own culture. Right to Constitutional Remedies This right empowers citizens to approach the court in cases of denial of anyof the Fundamental Rights. The court of law stands as a guard against theviolation of these rights. Under this right, it is the duty of the Judiciary to attend to all complaints pertaining to violation or rights. Directive Principles Apart from these there are some Directive Principles of State Policy that incorporate such rights as are required for the overall development of human kind. zThese Principles include rights like the right to work, right to equal wage for equal work, right to an adequate livelihood, right to free and compulsory education of children up to the age of 14 years etc. zThe state should take measures to preserve the good health of labourersand minor children and to ensure that they are not forced to undertake any work that harms their health. zThe state should promote public health and animal husbandry. zDecentralisation of power should reach the grassroots level. For that, Panchayati Raj must be established. zThe state should protect the academic and economic benefits of theweaker sections.

In addition to that, free legal assistance should be extended to the economically weaker sections of society to help get them justice.

All members of the community receive equaltreatment and information about different government schemes and opportunities so as to avail of these services. zMy village provides all its inhabitants equal access to resources, especially water, irrespective of their caste, sex and religion. zWhenever someone violates the rights of another person, the villagecommittee takes note of it, discusses and takes appropriate decision andaction with the consent of all the committee members, keeping in view the policies and procedures of the committee.

Are your attending the Gram Panchayat? zNo one in your village is subjected to degrading treatment or punishment. zMy village Panchayat has people from diverse backgrounds, religion andcultures. There are some women members in our Panchayat. There are33% seats reserved in the Panchayat for women. zI can express my political, religious and cultural ideas and beliefs to myfamily and community without fear of discrimination. zMembers of my village actively participate in decision-making processesrelated to village and community development through the village GramSabha. zThe village members and labourers are paid as per minimum wage norms. zBoth men and women are paid equal wages for equal work.

To exercise the community’s Right to Health you alsoneed to monitor, identify gaps and articulate their health care needs to the appropriate health care providers. Therefore, you need to be well aware of the health structure, systems and its operational issues and standards. Different health services are available at various levels. Let us first learn about them. Usually the health services are available at the state, district,cluster and village levels. Village level At the village level there is a Sub-Centre. It provides the following health services under various programmes: PAGE 237 25Reproductive and Child Health Programme (RCH). Under this programme the following services are provided.

As an ASHA you need to be well-versed with servicesavailable at the Sub-Centre and the PHC. Knowing only about the services isalso not enough.

After listening to them, help them to make an informed decision regarding their treatmentand any procedure (risk and safety factors) and choose the most suitablealternative if there is a choice available. zThe essential equipment, supplies and technical staff must be availableat the facility. Patient/s must not be told that due to unavailability of drugs or equipment being out of order s/he cannot receive the necessary service. zPrivacy, comfort, confidentiality, and dignity of the patient are to bemaintained- have curtains in examination rooms, allow the patient’srelatives and family to accompany her/him, if desired, and keepregisters/files locked. zBehaviour of the health care providers need to be courteous,non-discriminatory and reassuring. zPatient must feel motivated enough by the health care providers and thesystem to continue and complete the treatment. zAppropriate and adequate treatment is be given.

It may be a great freedom fighter , a popular politician or a renowned religious guru. All thesepeople have some common qualities, they alter a challenging situation or a problem into an opportunity. Leadership can be defined as mobilising people and resources towards achieving valued goals. Through knowledge and experience most people have the potential to become a leader in any given situation. Effective leadership in the community requires skills like team building, communication, conflict resolution, negotiation and advocacy for change. As an ASHA you often have to play the role of a leader. Hence it is important to understand the meaning of leadership and qualities, which will help you in playing your leadership roles effectively. Leadership means zto be responsible zto inspire people to follow you zto be non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions zto show confidence, assertiveness, enthusiasm, passion and accountability zto have skills for getting things\n",

He took people along with him to achieve freedom for our country. Let us see the principles that he followed as a leader. Courage: Courage to stand up and be accountable for your beliefs and opinions If your community’s Right to Health is violated, as an ASHA you need to have courage to bring it to the notice of the concerned stakeholders. For example,if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting thehouses of socially backward families have courage to tell her that you havenoted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. If she does not listen, be ready to inform the Sarpanch, SHG members and even the medical officer. Continue your efforts till you ensure that she visits all thepeople in your village regularly. Responsibility: Carry out your role and responsibility honestly As a leader you need to be responsible, first person for your self and then foryour community. As an ASHA you are given specific roles and responsibilities.You should inform your community of these. This will prove useful in two ways: zIf they are aware about your roles they will be able to bring it to your notice if you are not performing it effectively. zThey will also support you in carrying out your roles and responsibilitiesmore effectively Encouragement: Invite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care Every individual needs encouragement. As a leader, whenever you meet anyone read the unwritten words on their forehead “I am important.” Encouragement comes by involving community members in the process whenavailing for them their entitlements from the public health system or bygiving them some responsibility to improve the health environment in thecommunity.

      "thecommunity. Improvement: Constantly enhancing your competencies As a leader, an ASHA should constantly improve her knowledge and skills. Be aware of any new decision made regarding the delivery of health services and any new schemes declared. Be in constant dialogue with the ANM as she is agood source of information. Your skills will improve by practising them. Youmay fail too. From failures you learn what should not be done. If you arerepeating your mistakes it means that you are not learning. By learning youwill be able to stand out. PAGE 246 34Leadership Style People adopt different leadership styles. The two common styles are zAuthoritarian zParticipatory Authoritarian leaders do not come forward for cooperation or collaboration. They are heavily task-oriented people. They expect people to do what they are told without question or debate. They are usually intolerant of what they do not agree with. It is difficult for community members to contribute theirviews or empower themselves under this kind of leadership. A participatory leader creates a positive environment in which all members can reach their highest potential. They encourage the community to reachthe set goals as effectively as possible, while also working tirelessly to strengthen the bonds among various members. They usually form and lead some of the most productive teams. As an ASHA, it is the most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership style. Some of the characteristics of participatory leadership are given below: Leaders establish goals and set the direction As an ASHA you need to articulate what is an achievable goal in your village.You should establish your goal and direction by involving your community as to how, where and when it would be completed. For example, there should not be any maternal death in the coming year in your village, or, All children of your village should be immunised in the next sixmonths. Leaders affirm and articulate values As leaders we need to have certain values like honesty, hardwork,trusteworthiness etc. You have to demonstrate these values in your actions. You may communicate to your community members that you are hardworking but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you. For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be fully immunised.\n",

      "members that you are hardworking but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you. For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be fully immunised. But when the ANM comes for immunisation you are notpresent.Then will people believe that you are a hardworking person? Leaders have high standards and high expectations As an ASHA you should be firm about receiving high quality health care services from the sub-centre and the PHC for your village community. Make sure that the ANM performs her role professionally. As an ASHA you should also provide her support to carry out her role effectively. For example, PAGE 247 35inform the community about the date and place of the health camp or day of visit of the ANM and encourage them to be present at the camp. If the health service provider ill-treats a community member, take a note of it and confront the person concerned. Leaders are accountable and responsible As an ASHA you are accountable, both to the community and the health careprovider. Be an effective link between both of them by sharing information from one end to the other. Some tips to be accountable: zYou will gain personal power and the ability to get results if you assume accountability in all situations, even if you do not immediately see theresults. zComplain only to the person who can do something about it. zConcentrating on blaming others or complaining will reduce your energyand the energy of people around you. zVenting your feelings once or twice is a good stress managementtechnique. Being constantly critical of them has no positive outcome. “Focus on action and not on blame” “If it is to be, it is up to me”“Light a candle instead of cursing the darkness ” Ultimately, you are the one responsible for yourself. You play a crucial part in every situation in your life. What you are today is a result of your choice. This is accountability. Leaders involve others in decision-making As a leader you have to make various decisions. A community leader rarelymakes a decision alone.

      "As a leader you have to make various decisions. A community leader rarelymakes a decision alone. By law, a decision, which affects the communityneeds to be taken along with the community members. The community needsto feel ownership of decisions taken. Only then they will do their best to achieve what they have decided. For example, as an ASHA you have to articulate and assert yourself for your community’s health needs. You need to decide and prioritise the health needsof the community along with community members and jointly develop a planof action. This will encourage them to join hands with you to take necessaryaction. Leaders motivates others To achieve the goal of the Right to Health you need the support of your PAGE 248 36community members, the Panchayat, SHG etc. As a leader, you need to motivate your community to join hands with you. Motivation comes through zBeing in regular contact with them zSharing necessary information regularly zGiving them responsibility zThanking them for their support zGiving them credit for their efforts z Appreciating them honestly in public Leaders achieve unity As a leader you need to promote unity among your community members andbetween the community members and health care providers. Unity can be achieved by listening to everyone’s points of view while taking decisions. Do not make anyone feel neglected since later they may become difficult personsto manage. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership of the goal that you have set as an ASHA for your village. Leaders serve as role models Leaders have followers. Therefore, it is very important that all your actions are responsible. For example, as an ASHA you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the lifeof woman in your village, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if required. Leader listen and explain Listening helps to make the process of decision-making easier and more meaningful. Also, the as a leader you need to articulate and explain your point of view.

      "helps to make the process of decision-making easier and more meaningful. Also, the as a leader you need to articulate and explain your point of view. For example, at the village level families are not proactive in preparing for the birth of a child. You need to listen to them about the reasons for theirlack of motivation. Based on their views, explain to them the need for birth preparedness and the likely consequences of poor birth preparedness. Share positive examples where birth preparedness has helped to save a woman’s life. PAGE 249 37Leaders represent the community A leader is the face of the community. As an ASHA, when you discuss the health concerns of your community with the health service provider, you arerepresenting your community. Share their points of view rather than merelyyours. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along with the Panchayat and health and sanitation committee. While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of the poor of your community. Share their feelings and opinions, and make sure that whateverdecision is taken to develop the health plan, reflects their voices. If somesegment of the community has shared that the source of drinking water isnot accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion whiledeveloping a comprehensive health plan for the village. As a leader some of the skills you need to build are zCommunication zDecision-making zNegotiation zCoordination PAGE 250 38 God gave us a mouth and two ears to communicate People failing to communicate create confusion, frustration and problems. Communication is the exchange or two-way flow of information and ideas between two or more persons. Communication is the most important skill to fulfill your role as an ASHA. There are different forms of communication zVerbal communication zNon-verbal communication zWritten communication As an ASHA you need to use all three types of communication. Verbal communication This is the most common mode of communication used. Normally, we think communication is completed once we have orally delivered the message. Butthat is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. Toknow if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/heunderstood the message and take feedback. In short, effective communication is two-way.\n",

      "message. Butthat is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. Toknow if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/heunderstood the message and take feedback. In short, effective communication is two-way. One-way communication is usually not effective. Communication Skills PAGE 251 39Some Tips for Effective Verbal Communication zAccuracy zClarity zCorrectness Points to take care of while communicating: zMaintain eye contact with the person with whom you are talking. zBe confident while communicating. Stand or sit confidently. zStick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time. zBe specific, sincere, honest and direct while communicating zShare feelings while communicating. zBe open-minded. This will help you to understand the other person’s point of view. zYour voice should be loud enough so that everyone can hear you. Your pronunciation should be clear. Use words which are easy to understand. Do not use technical words or jargon. zIf someone has something worth mentioning, give them scope to do so.Never forget to compliment/appreciate others. The speaker is assured that you are listening when you use verbal affirmations like, “I see,” I” agree”, “uh, okay, then….” during the conversation at appropriate points. Non-Verbal Communication We all know that communication is not only about words and languages. Evensilence communicates and eyes talk. Hence, it is important to understandthese forms of communication which are referred to as non-verbalcommunication. Here are some non-verbal behavioural aspects which require extra attention. zEye contact : Looking at the person with whom you are talking is an effective way of declaring that you are sincere/honest about what you aresaying and also communicates confidence. zBody posture : The value or weight of your messages will increase if you face the person, stand or sit appropriately close and hold your head erect. zFacial expressions : Express appropriate feelings on your face. Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions. zGestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. zVoice characteristics : The volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should be well modulated.

      "volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should be well modulated. PAGE 252 40Active Listening is Communication too All of us can hear, but all of us cannot listen. Hearing and listening are not the same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening involves the reception andinterpretation of what is heard. It decodes the sound heard meaningfully.Does a knock on the door sound the same all the time? What if you are aloneand you hear a knock late at night? What happens if you hear a knock whenyou are expecting someone whom you like? Active listening involves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain information, obtain directions, understand others, solve problems, shareinterests, see how the other person feels, or even show support. This type oflistening takes the same amount of, or more, energy than speaking. Itrequires the listener to hear various messages, understand the meaning andthen verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. Following are some of the tips for good listening: zMaintain eye contact zSit or stand in a receptive position, lean forward zEncourage by using positive gestures and words zRemove distractions zUnderstand non-verbal signals zStop talking or doing what you were doing before you began listening zGive time for listening zDo not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking zReflect on the feeling expressed and paraphrase what has been heard zHave patience As an ASHA, keep the following points in mind while communicating with your community. zNever discriminate on the basis of caste and class while communicatingwith the community. Your tone and gesture should not change while talkingto socially and economically disadvantaged community members. Talk tothem with respect and dignity. zA community has immense knowledge and experience. Give people achance to share and use it. Do not treat them like empty vessels. zNever make any comment which emphasises gender inequality. Yourcommunication should be gender-sensitive. zDo not react fast. Listen, assimilate, analyse and then react. PAGE 253 41As an ASHA, you need to keep the following points in mind while communicating with stakeholders zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the\n",

      "mind while communicating with stakeholders zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the necessary information, data and evidence. Never generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not want from them, what you want to change and what you want to continue. zBe calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety. zDo not use a blaming tone. You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will affect those around you. And, of course, confidence and assertiveness will help get your message through. A point to note – think before you speak. Written Communication As an ASHA you would need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You also need to document theprocesses and decisions taken during meetings. Let us first learn how to write simply and effectively. Read the following letter: Dear Sir, There are many women in villages in different areas, which is far away from the place where the ANC clinic is organised. Especially in thesummer season, the women cannot travel long distances to the clinicand hence cannot get their ANC check-ups done. If the clinic can be conducted in two areas on different dates all women can come there and benefit.I request this on behalf of all the community women. Thank you ASHA Village name Do you clearly understand what the letter is about? It is a well-intended effort to bring to the notice of the person concerned the conditions that deprive the village women of the ANC’s services and also PAGE 254 42suggests solutions to overcome this problem. But since it is not clear and specific, it does not seem to be effective. The letter can be made more effective if it includes the following details:Before starting to write an application/letter, every writer should ask1. Do I know what I want to say the (the subject)?2. Do I know to whom I am writing? 3. Do I know why I am writing? Read the same letter given below and see the difference between the first letter and the second. To Date ___________(Name\n",

To Date ___________(Name and address)___________ ___________ Sub: request to organise MAMTA Day at two locations in the villageDear CDHO (write the name of the concerned person):I am working as ASHA for the village ________ of________ Block. My village has a population of ________ . The houses are scattered across the areas. The ANM regularly comes and organises MAMTA Day. However, it is organised at a place which is not accessible for all the pregnant women. A large number of women living on the other side of the village, are notable to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance. I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the village on different dates. I had a discussion about the same with theANM. She informed me that she needs permission from you. I request you to look into this matter. As an ASHA I take the responsibility to bring all the pregnant women so they have their antenatal check-up. You arewelcome to visit our village. Thank you. Yours sincerely, ASHA (write name of ASHA and the village) PAGE 255 43There are many points to be kept in view in order to convey our messages correctly and precisely. The principles of writing include several do’s anddon’ts Some Do’s1. Address it to the appropriate person2. Check that the letter has a date and reference 3. Keep sentences short 4. Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones5. Do not be vague and mention the reference points for clarity6. Never assume that the reader is aware of the facts and would understand them. 7. Review your writing to add any missing points 8. Write and re-write the letter to get the essence correctly. 9. Explain facts through evidence and examples10.The letter should flow logically from one point to another11.Write with a view to express and not to impress Some Don’ts 1. Avoid unnecessary words 2.

Do not use ambiguous sentences and universal negatives PAGE 256 44 Each decision that we make has a consequence and a level of impact. Even a small decision has the potential to drastically change the course of our lives.All of us can recall some such decisions taken personally or by others whichhave left an important impact. Decision-making is a learned skill and must bepracticed consciously to strengthen it. As an ASHA you would often require to take some decisions, which will effect the community at large. Hence, it is very important for you to master theskill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. There are some basic steps of decision-making which need to be followed: Define the Problem Look at the situation carefully and examine it from all perspectives to find out the actual problem. For example, you have observed frequent occurence of malaria in the village, affecting the basic health status of the people, especially women andchildren. Malaria seems to be the problem and needs to be eradicated.However, the root problem is drainage water coming out of every housecollecting near residential areas and schools. Decision-Making Skills PAGE 257 45To eradicate malaria completely you need to mobilise people and think of solutions to control the drainage problem. Gather Information Once the problem is identified, collect all the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Use allavailable resources in a way to amicably solve this issue. Think of Alternatives At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meetingand discuss the situation with people with whom you have worked with to collect information regarding the problem. You may also present this in the Gram Sabha. What is important is that people accept and understand theproblem. Later, alternative solutions may be suggested. In participatory decision-making, it is very important that the community owns the problem and feels responsible towards solving it. Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a permanent basis. Choose an Alternative Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative from the various options available. This can\n",

      "it. Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a permanent basis. Choose an Alternative Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative from the various options available. This can be done through consensus of thecommunity and approval, of the authorities. To gain consensus and approvalyou would need to discuss it in the village meetings, the Gram Sabha,Panchayat meetings etc. Before selecting the right alternative, assess all available options. It is important to be practical in taking a decision. Put the Decisions to Work An effective decision is one which can be put into action. Thus,implementation is very important. During this process, keep checking if it ismoving towards the expected solution, and if there is something else whichneeds to be addressed. Nobody is an expert in every skill.They can be mastered only through practice. Hence, decision-making skills can also be sharpened throughexperience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. This is part of the learning process. Accepting responsibility foryour actions is a very important quality and a sign of maturity. PAGE 258 46How to Handle Difficult Situations If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue andreview the options. It is also may be a good idea to adjourn and let peoplethink about it overnight. Description of an Effective Decision zAn effective decision should not leave any unhappy feelingamong group members after the meeting has beenadjourned. zAn effective decision can be translated into reality. It shouldnot be decision impossible to put in action. zAn effective decision can be lived with. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature among persons or groups. zAn effective decision must involve the group enough for the members to implement the decision.

Negotiation means dealing with differences between two or more individuals or groups. As an ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these differences to achieve the larger goals of villagehealth programmes. Let us build an understanding of the process ofnegotiation. Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. Because negotiating is an inter-personal process, each negotiating situation is different, and is influenced by each party’s skills, attitudes and style. Weoften look at negotiating as unpleasant because it implies conflict, butnegotiating need not be characterised by bad feelings or angry behavior.Understanding more about the negotiation process allows us to manage ournegotiations with confidence and increases the chance that the outcomes will be positive for both parties. Negotiations need not be confrontational by being offensive, insulting and challenging. In fact, effective negotiation is characterised by groups workingtogether to find a solution, rather than each group trying to WIN at any cost.Negotiation Skills PAGE 260 48Keep in mind that the attitude that you take in a negotiation (e.g, hostile or cooperative) will set the tone for the interaction. If you are confrontational,you will have a fight on your hands. Negotiating is a complex process but definitely one worth mastering. If you keep in mind that you are responsible for the success or failure of the negotiation, and if you follow the tips given here, you will find the process easier. We need to understand that in a successful negotiation everyone wins. The objective should be agreement, not victory or to make the other party orperson feel low. As an ASHA you will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to fulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to negotiate with people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situationwhich requires negotiation.

      "people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situationwhich requires negotiation. Let us Understand the steps of Successful Negotiation Ask for the other person’s perspective In a negotiating situation use questions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. Some examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? What are your concerns about what I amsuggesting/asking? When you hear the other person express their needs orconcerns, use appropriate listening responses to make sure you heardcorrectly. State Your needs In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but also why you need it. Prepare options beforehandBefore entering into a negotiating session, prepare some options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not acceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and be prepared to counter the same with an alternative. Do not argueNegotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about trying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation each party tries toprove the other one wrong, no progress is made. Do not waste time in arguing. If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a powerstruggle. PAGE 261 49Consider timing There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on either side, apreoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or tiredness on oneside or the other. The best outcome for almost all negotiations is a win/win situation when both parties walk away with a positive feeling about having achieved their goals. Suggestions for Effective Negotiation While negotiating as an ASHA you must have unlimited patience. Never try tomake the opponent feel low and defeated. Emphathise with the other personto understand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings.

Approach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right tohave an opinion of your own.”You may think that this is being soft and noteffective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. PAGE 262 50 Coordination Skills As an ASHA you are a link between health care services and the community. Therefore, you are expected to regularly coordinate with various stakeholders and the community.

The most common way of coordination is to meet the concerned person regularly and discuss the issueor share information. Another way of coordination is to call a meeting. Youmay need special skills for effective coordination. Let us understand them. Each meeting needs to be productive. A productive meeting is well-planned and result-oriented. Unproductive meetings are too long, vague in purpose, poorly controlled and frustrating. zDecide the agenda of the meeting. Decide who should be called. Invite only those people who can contribute to the meeting and take follow-upactions. zShare the agenda with the concerned persons. This is very critical. At the village level there may be no need to send a written agenda, However you need to clearly orally inform them about the purpose of the meeting andthe points, which need to be discussed. zAt the beginning of the meeting, welcome all the participants. Make acircular sitting arrangement to enable an enriching conversation/dialogue. zExplain the purpose of the meeting again and make sure\n",

In addition, this module includes the development of speciﬁ c competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching. Acknowledgements The sections on maternal and newborn care are excerpted from the SEARCH Manual on ‘How to Train ASHA in Home-Based Newborn Care’ and SEARCH developed ASHA Reading Material on Home-Based Newborn Care.

PAGE 275 PART A Being an ASHA PAGE 276 PAGE 277 Part A Being an ASHA 7Being an ASHA 1. Role of ASHA ASHA is considered to be a healthcare facilitator and provider of a limited range of healthcare services. Health rights would be integral to her work and would be focused in the areas of community mobilisation to improve health status, access to services, and promote people’s participation in health programmes. PART A Didi, which day is the ANM coming to our village? Didi, they are charging me at the govt hospital and I don’t have the money to pay – can you help me?This is the first day of diarrhoea. Do I have go to the far away town or is there something you can suggest?Objectives of this Session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about:• The role of an ASHA and the activities expected of her. • The health outcomes that her work should result in.• The sets of skills that she needs to be eﬀ ective in. • The records that she has to maintain. • The arrangements for her support and supervision. PAGE 278 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 82. Activities of an ASHA ASHA’s work consists mainly of ﬁ ve activities: 1. Home Visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or ﬁ ve days a week, the ASHA should visit the families living in her allo/g308 ed area. Home visits should take place at least once in a month if not more. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, families will come to her when there is a problem and she would not have to go so o/g286 en to their houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/ village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for\n",

      "houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/ village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the house, a series of ﬁ ve visits or more becomes essential. 2. A/g308 ending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide immunisation and other services in the village, ASHA will promote a/g308 endance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM services and helps with service delivery. 3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant woman or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort. The visit could also be to a/g308 end a training programme or review meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit, in others, there would be more. 4. Holding village level meeting of women’s groups, and the Village Health and Sanitation Commi/g308 ee (VHSC), for increasing health awareness and to plan health work. 5. Maintain records which would make her more organised and make her work easier, and help her to plan be/g308 er for the health of the people. The ﬁ rst three relate to facilitation or provision of healthcare and the last two are supportive and mobilisational activities. PAGE 279 Part A Being an ASHA 93. Measurable Outcomes of the ASHA Programme In the course of conducting these ﬁ ve activities, the ASHA should ensure the following: Maternal Health 1. That every pregnant woman and her family receive health information for promotion of appropriate healthcare practices – diet, rest and for increased use of services which would focus on care in pregnancy, delivery, postnatal care and family planning services. 2. That every pregnant woman avails of antenatal care and postnatal care at the monthly health worker clinic/VHND. 3. That every family with a pregnant woman has made a plan and is prepared for the event of childbirth. 4. That every couple that needs contraceptive services is counselled on where to avail of the service. Newborn and Child Health 1. That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286\n",

That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286 en if there are problems and receives essential home-based care as well as appropriate referral for the sick newborn. 2. That every family receives the information and support it needs to access immunisation. 3. That all families with children below the age of two years are counselled and supported for – prevention and management of malnutrition and anaemia and for prevention of illness such as malaria, recurrent diarrhoea and respiratory infection. 4. That every child below ﬁ ve years with diarrhoea, fever, Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and worms, brought to her a/g308 ention is counselled on whether referral is immediately required or whether, given the problems of access to a doctor, ﬁ rst contact curative care with home remedies and drugs in her kit, the child can be managed. Disease Control 1. That those individuals noticed during home visits as having chronic cough or blindness or a skin patch in a high leprosy block are referred to the appropriate centre for further check-up. 2. That those prescribed a long course of drugs for tuberculosis or leprosy or surgery for cataract are followed up and encouraged to take the drugs or go for surgery. 3. That those with fever which could be malaria (or kala – azar) have their blood tested to detect the disease and provide appropriate care/referral. 4. That the village and health authorities are alerted to any outbreak of disease she notes during her visits. Note: Each outcome is not a separate activity. They are part of the protocol followed during a single activity _ the home visit. PAGE 280 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 104. Essential Skills for an ASHA The essential skills that an ASHA requires can be classiﬁ ed into six sets. These are simple skills requiring only a few hours to learn, but they can save thousands of lives. These six sets of skills are given below: 1. Maternal Care a. Counselling of pregnant women b. Ensuring complete antenatal care through home visits and enabling care at VHND c.\n",

Qualities that Make an ASHA Effective PAGE 283 Part A Being an ASHA 136. Conducting a Home Visit The purpose of the home visit is to interact with the family, especially the young women of the house, so as to develop a rapport with them, communicate key health messages, support them for be/g308 er healthcare practices, identify illness early and provide appropriate advice. In particular, homes with a pregnant woman, or a woman who had an abortion or delivery within the last one month, or with any child below two or any malnourished child needs regular home visits. The ﬁ rst step is to gather information to understand the situation. You should ask appropriate initial questions, listen to the woman’s response actively, and do not interrupt the woman while she is speaking. Once the mother has ﬁ nished, ask further questions to clarify what she has said. Then seek more information by asking more detailed and probing questions about the duration of illness and the symptoms. The second step a/g286 er listening is to ﬁ rst praise the mother for how she is managing and reinforce the correct actions she is taking. Then make suggestions to the mother/woman on what further she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information. Repeat the key information to make sure that the mother has understood it. You should ask whether the All Visits (Basic communication skills\n",

You should ask whether the All Visits (Basic communication skills to create friendly environment) • Greeting. • Explain why she is visiting today. • Act in a way so family feels they can confide in her. • Speak in a gentle tone. • Use simple words in local language. • Be respectful. • Praise what the woman is doing correctly and build up her self-confidence. • Point out why you are discouraging some health practices; do not merely condemn it or brand it as bad, superstition etc. • Ask, don’t tell. • Check if the woman has any questions. • Answer in simple language. • Thank the woman after the visit and inform the family when you (ASHA) will return. PAGE 284 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 14suggestion is applicable and acceptable, and whether she would be able to implement it. If necessary, ask the woman to repeat what has been suggested. Discuss further and come to an understanding of what can be done Then the third step, you should discuss and try to correct any misconceptions or rumours. Finally, you should also arrange for follow-up visit or referral. Do NOT “prescribe” health advice: You need to “counsel.” See the examples below: Gratuitous Ineffective Messages Useful Health Communication Message To prevent diarrhoea, pay attention to cleanliness. To prevent diarrhoea, please ensure that you wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food or feeding the child and after cleaning up after defecation. Take good care of the child. Are you able to find enough time to feed the child? To play with the child? Who looks after the child when you are at work? Your child is now one year old. You must give it nutritious food. Would it be possible for you to give your child an egg daily (or milk, green vegetables etc)? How would you manage it? Can you afford it?

Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) VHND is a common platform for allowing the people to access the services of the ANM and the male health worker and of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC). It is held at the AWC once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the children, provides antenatal care to pregnant women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. In addition, the ANM provides a basic level of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. The VHND is an occasion for health communication on a number of key health issues. It should be a/g308 ended by the members of the PRI, particularly the women members, pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. The VHND is to be seen as a major mobilisation event to reinforce health messages. You should provide information on the topics given below during the VHND. These topics can be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. Topics for Health Communication during the VHND • Care in pregnancy, including nutrition, importance of antenatal care and danger sign recognition. • Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care. • Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate complementary feeding. • Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking\n",

Maintaining drug kit stocks: You are provided with a drug kit so as to be able to treat minor ailments/problems. The drug kit contains: Paracetomol tablets, Albendazole tablets, Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets, Chloroquine tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), and eye ointment. In addition, the kit may contain condoms and oral contraceptive pills, pregnancy testing kits, and malaria testing kits. The contents of the kit may change depending on the needs of the state. The drug kit is to be re-ﬁ lled on a regular basis from the nearest PHC. To keep a record of consumption of the drugs, and for eﬀ ective re-ﬁ lling and ensuring adequate/timely availability, a drug kit stock card is maintained. This can be completed by the person who reﬁ lls the kit or by you. (Annexe 1: Sample drug kit stock card) PAGE 288 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 189. ASHA Support and Supervision • For ASHA to be eﬀ ective and for her skills to be updated, she needs both on-the-job support and refresher trainings. • Each ASHA will be supported in the ﬁ eld by an ASHA facilitator. • The ASHA facilitator will interact with ASHA at least twice if not thrice a month. • At least one of these interactions will be in the form of a “mentoring” visit to the hamlet where she provides her services. This would focus on mentoring or on-the-job training. • Another one or two interactions would be in a local review meeting. This could be held at Gram Panchayat (GP) level, or at the sector level or even at the block level. • Each of the facilitators will have a clear protocol of activities to follow for the mentoring visit to the ASHAs and for the review meetings. The purpose of these interactions are: a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and information on what work ASHA is doing. b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems they encounter. c For providing\n",

Pregnancy Diagnosis Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as possible a/g286 er the ﬁ rst missed period. There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early: • Missed Periods • Pregnancy testing: through use of the Nischay home pregnancy test card /rhombus6 The Nischay test card can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. /rhombus6 The test can be done immediately a/g286 er the missed period. /rhombus6 A positive test means that the woman is pregnant. /rhombus6 The beneﬁ t of early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be registered early by the ANM and start ge/g308 ing antenatal care soon. /rhombus6 A negative test means that the woman is not pregnant. In case she is not pregnant and does not want to get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt a family planning method. /rhombus6 The result of the test should be kept conﬁ dential. Instructions for the use of the Nishcay Kit are in Annexe 2. PART B 1 All knowledge areas in this chapter have been covered in ASHA Module 2. Objectives of this session By the end of the session the ASHA will learn about: • Diagnosing pregnancy using Nischay Kit. • Determining Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up 1. • Identiﬁ cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral. • Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up\n",

PAGE 292 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 22 Determining LMP and EDD When pregnancy is diagnosed, you should help the pregnant woman in calculating the probable date when she is likely to deliver. Steps to ﬁ nd the EDD• Find out from the woman the date of the ﬁ rst day of her LMP .• Then count nine months a/g286 er that date.• Add seven days to that date.For example, If the ﬁ rst day of the LMP is: 10th Dec. 2009 Nine months later is: 10th Sept. 2010 Adding seven days is: 17th Sept. 2010 Therefore, the expected date of delivery is 17th September 2010 Note: This method only gives an approximate date of delivery, and baby may be born anytime during 15 days before or after the EDD.

The nearest place for ANC services for a woman is at the AWC during the monthly VHND. The pregnant w oman could also go to the Sub-Centre, where the ANM will provide ANC services. ANC services are also provided at the PHC or Community Health Centre (CHC) or district hospital. Identification of problems and danger signs Given below are complications that can occur during the antenatal period for which pregnant w omen must seek treatment in an institution: • Jaundice, high blood pressure, fever with chills, or bleeding • Severe anaemia • Women with protein and sugar in their urine• Swelling of feet, face and hands.Given below are danger signs for which pregnant women must seek delivery in a centre where they can manage complications including those requiring surgery and blood transfusion. • Mothers who had a complication in a previous pregnancy (C section, prolonged labour, stillborn, neonatal death) • Pregnant women with severe anaemia.• Pregnant women having any of the danger signs of the antenatal period which are still persisting at the time of delivery. Some women are to be considered more at risk of developing complications during delivery and therefore, must opt for an institutional delivery. These include: • Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough\n",

PAGE 295 25 Maternal HealthPart B• Emphasise the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet during pregnancy. The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of cereals, pulses (including beans and nuts), vegetables including greens, milk, eggs, meat and ﬁ sh. If possible, the family should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. Meat and nuts are especially good for anaemic women. You should explain to the mother and family that no foods should be forbidden during pregnancy. • See when ANC is due for each check-up and remind them appropriately. • Escort pregnant woman to VHND where they are hesitant or need such support. • Ensure that all components of ANC are delivered.• Ensure that the Maternal Card is updated. Planning for a Safe Delivery You should • Know how to calculate the EDD and communicate this to the pregnant woman. • Know which institutions in the area provide different levels of care and establish linkages with providers there. • At least once before delivery, take the pregnant woman to this centre and introduce her to the providers. • Know what transport is available _ whether funded by the state or other private means _ that is easily accessible and affordable and how to call on it when the need arises. • Assist all pregnant women and families to prepare plans for birth: including identifying funding sources should money be required at short notice.

Sometimes Self-Help Groups (SHGs) may advance money in emergency even if the woman is not a member. This is most important for women in remote hamlets, or in communities which are currently not availing of institutional delivery or those at high risk for complications. • Know what records (BPL card) need to be carried to the institution. • Share birth plans with ANM and PHC MO at the VHND or monthly meeting. • Identify mothers with complications, or a high likelihood of developing complications with support from the ANM. Inform them of the institutions that it is most advisable for them to go to and motivate the mother and the family to go there and escort them if required.

This is a method of planning in advance by the pregnant mother and her family for a safe and comfortable deliv ery and for care a/g286 er delivery. You should help every family make this plan in consultation with the ANM. What are the choices available to the mother? 1. If there are any danger signs or complications: Identify the nearest institution (CHC/District Hospital) which has the staﬀ and equipment to provide Comprehensiv e Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC), and counsel the mother and the family to go there. 2. If there are no complications: Counsel the mother to go to the PHC which is open 24 X 7, where there is a team of doctors and nurses or ANMs to conduct the delivery and provide care for the mother and newborn. These institutions can manage some complications and transfer immediately to a higher facility if complications requiring surgery or blood transfusion develop. The list of such institutions can be obtained from the ANM. The place should be clean and safe and friendly and have a skilled nurse or doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a/g286 er delivery. 3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7\n",

If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7 PHC or if it is too far away: Advise the mother could go the Sub-Centre, provided it is accredited as a delivery centre, which means the ANM has been trained as a Skilled Birth A/g308 endant (SBA), and is available, and there are minimum facilities for delivery. 4. If there are no complications or not a high risk case for developing complications and the mother and family insist on delivering at home, despite counselling: You could work with the ANM to enable a delivery by SBA. This should be agreed to only if you are sure that the family can organise transport and funds at very short notice. The SBA should be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the onset of labour at the home/Sub-Centre and should able to stay through the process of labour and for a few hours a/g286 erwards. A team of two or three women with experience in a/g308 ending at labour would be helpful. What does a birth preparedness plan contain? (See Annexe-3 for format for individual plan) When should a birth preparedness plan be readied? It should be ready as early as possible a/g286 er conﬁ rming the pregnancy, and in consultation with the family (husband, mother-in-law, or other decision makers). You should review the plan in the third trimester (a/g286 er seventh month) with the family and the ANM. At this time, the choice of institution and the transport should be ﬁ nalised.

But if she and her family do not want to go that far and the 24X7 PHC is crowded, I will advise her to go to the nearby sub-centre where two ANMs are trained to conduct deliveries and one of them is always there. For some women, family circumstances and beliefs make even going to the sub-centre diffi cult. I will then get the ANM to come to her house, and will assist in the preparations needed, after counselling that a safe delivery in this situation may not always be possible. If I go to the PHC which is open 24 hours, I will be cared for and can rest for two days. Also, if there is any surgery needed, they can rush me to the big hospital quickly. Woman’s choice I will also need to ensure that I have an escort, maybe the ASHA, to accompany me, and that someone is taking care of the children and things at home. If danger signs or complications develop before the delivery, I will need to go to the big hospital straight away, but I hope that does not happen. If she has no complications, I will counsel her to go to the 24X7 PHC, and for this too, I must ensure that transport arrangements are made in time. PAGE 298 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 283. Management of Anaemia In India, anaemia among women is very common. The chances of a mother having a delivery before term, or even dying are higher among mothers with severe anaemia. In order to make sure that all women have good iron stores, all pregnant women should be given iron tablets, even if they are not anaemic. Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test, which measures the amount of a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb). Low levels of Hb mean that the woman has anaemia (see box below). The test should be performed during the antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal 7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia If a woman\n",

Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal 7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia If a woman during the time of pregnancy has Hb level below 11g/dl, she is considered to be suﬀ ering from anaemia. Common symptoms of severe anaemia include:• Very pale tongue• Weakness• General swelling in body. For women who do not have anaemia (Hb more than 11 g/dl) The pregnant woman should take one tablet of IFA every day for at least 100 days (prophylactic dose), starting a/g286 er the ﬁ rst trimester, at least 14-16 weeks of gestation to prevent anaemia. This dosage regimen is to be repeated again for three months a/g286 er the delivery. If a woman is found to be anaemic: • The woman should be given two IFA tablets per day for three months. This means that a pregnant w oman with anaemia needs to take at least 200 tablets of IF A. Besides taking IFA tablets, you should encourage the pregnant woman, where possible, to increase her dietary intake of iron-rich food. • The Hb level should be estimated again a/g286 er one month. If the level increases, you should tell the woman to continue with two tablets of IFA daily until the Hb comes to normal. If the Hb does not rise in spite of taking IFA tablets, in the prescribed dose, you should refer the woman to the nearest facility that is equipped to manage complications in pregnancy. • You should refer women with severe anaemia immediately to the nearest PHC/CHC/DH for further treatment. Such women may need injections or blood transfusions. PAGE 299 29 Maternal HealthPart B• The dosage regimen of two IFA tablets per day should be repeated for three months post-partum also. Counselling pregnant women on anaemia: • Encourage women to take iron-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, whole pulses, ragi, jaggery, meat and liver. This advice should be discussed with family and ﬁ nalised based on the family situation. • Encourage the woman, where possible, to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption\n",

If the woman has nausea and pain in abdomen, she may take the tablets a/g286 er meals or at night. This will avoid nausea. • Dispel the myths and misconceptions related to IFA and convince the woman about the importance of taking it. An example of a common myth is that the consumption of IFA may aﬀ ect baby’s complexion. • Many women do not take IFA tablets regularly due to some common side-eﬀ ects such as nausea, constipation and black stools. Tell women not to worry about passing black stool while consuming IFA. It is normal. • In case of constipation, the woman should drink more water and add roughage (plenty of green leafy vegetables) to her diet. • IFA tablets should not be consumed with tea, coﬀ ee, milk or calcium tablet as it reduces the absorption of iron. • IFA tablets may make the woman feel less tired than before. However, despite feeling be/g308 er, she should not stop taking the tablets and must complete the course as advised by the healthcare provider. • Ask the woman to return to you if she has problem taking IFA tablets. How do you get the IFA?The IFA tablets are part of your drug kit. Try to ensure that you always have enough stock. Either your facilitator or a person appointed by the MO of the PHC is given the responsibility of reﬁ lls for the drug kit. IFA tablets are also made available at VHND or in any health facility.

Care during Delivery Observation of the delivery process was not part of previous ASHA training modules. In this module, you will be oriented to normal delivery processes and newborn care, and also develop the skills for recording the various events and pregnancy outcome. Even though you are not required to manage delivery, you may have to help if the delivery starts during transport. This knowledge also gives you conﬁ dence to know more about this. You should try and stay with the pregnant woman through delivery in the institution or at home, and post-partum period. You could therefore also be a ‘Birth Companion’ to the mother during the stay at the institution. This is not a compulsion, but a desirable service. Alternatively, a close relative could also be the birth companion. PAGE 305 35 Maternal HealthPart BBefore Delivery The delivery room should be cleaned before the delivery. If the delivery is happening at home, you should facilitate a clean delivery space. Immediately after birth, if the baby remains naked, it may become cold. Hence, baby clothes should be kept ready before delivery. 1st Stage of labour Starts from the beginning of pain until the mouth of the womb is fully open. This happens inside and cannot be seen. The bag of water also breaks at the end of this stage. The fluid is usually clear but may be yellow or green or red. If green, it indicates infection.

Points for you to pay attention to if you are also present at the time of delivery in the institution: • It is not necessary to shave the area, or give an enema to the mother at the time of delivery. • All deliveries do not require an episiotomy (cut at the perineal site). • Fundal pressure (pushing on the abdomen) should not be applied. • You should be alert if injections are being given to hasten the delivery process. Such injections can cause a baby who is still born, birth of a baby who is unable to breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should give the injection.\n",

The very top of the head comes ﬁ rst, then the eyes, nose and mouth (d). While in most babies, the eyes are facing the ﬂ oor; sometimes they are born looking towards the ceiling. When the baby’s head is out, it turns to one side (e) and the shoulders and rest of the body are delivered (f). Once out, the baby will cry.

She can eat any kind of food but high protein foods – pulses and legumes (nuts are especially useful), foods of animal source. She should also drink plenty of ﬂ uids. Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Schedule of visits and tasks to be performed at each visit.• Understand the possible complications of the post-partum period.• Be able to identify the complications and refer appropriately.

Caution her on the risk of unprotected sex and the high chances of conceiving again. You should counsel her on the importance of spacing the next child birth for her own health and that of the baby. You should help her in making the choice of the method of family planning, whether spacing or limiting. Complications during the post-partum period Some women can develop complications a/g286 er the childbirth. The symptoms of these major complications are: 1. Excessive bleeding: Ask the mother if the bleeding is heavy. O/g286 en this is quite obvious, but sometimes it may be diﬃ cult to judge. If the woman is using more than ﬁ ve pads a day or more than one thick cloth in a day, she is having heavy bleeding. You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications. You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding.\n",

You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding. Referral is most urgent. Even the delay of a few minutes can make a diﬀ erence. 2. Puerperal Sepsis (Infections): Ask if the discharge is foul smelling. If the answer is yes, then suspect infection. Fever, chills and pain in abdomen along with the foul smell make infections even more likely. You should measure temperature to conﬁ rm fever. Referral is required since the mother needs antibiotics. Referral on the same day is advisable. 3. Convulsions with or without swelling of face and hands, severe headache, and blurred vision: Such patients need immediate referral. If ANM is available within 15 minutes, she can stabilise the patient before referral. 4. Anaemia: You should check if the mother is pale and enable the mother to get her blood Hb status checked (for management of anaemia in the post-partum period, please see Section 3). 5. Breast engorgement and Infection: (Part C: Newborn Health) PAGE 310 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 406. Perineal Swelling and Infection: If the mother has a small tear at the opening of her vagina (or has had stitches during the delivery), she should keep the area clean. She can apply cloth dipped in hot water, twice a day and hold it to her genitals. This will give her relief and help the healing. If there is fever, she should be referred to the PHC or CHC. A tablet of paracetomol would help both the pain and the fever. 7. Post-Partum Mood Changes: Some women may suﬀ er from mood changes a/g286 er delivery. They need counselling and family support. The changes usually disappear a/g286 er a week or so. If the changes become severe then referral is required.

Care of the Baby at the time of Delivery Many babies die immediately after birth due to asphyxia. In case of home delivery, when mild labour pains start, you can manage asphyxiated babies by removing mucus and can initiate respiration with the help of the instruments you have. You should encourage the mother to start breastfeeding immediately after the delivery, as this will help in quick delivery of placenta and minimises bleeding. Starting to breastfeed immediately after the birth makes the baby stronger. Chances of the baby’s death and getting sick are higher among the babies born before time (pre-term) and in LBW babies, (Weight less than 2500 gm increases the risk and below 1800 gm, the risk is considered very high.) PAGE 314 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 442. Schedule of Home Visits for the care of the Newborn The purpose of these visits is to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, discourage harmful practices such as bo/g308 le feeds, early baths, giving other substances by mouth, and to identify early signs of sepsis or other illnesses in the newborn. • The newborn requires a visit immediately a/g286 er birth (or within the ﬁ rst 24 hours), and on Day 2, if the baby is born at home. • If the baby is born at a facility, persuade and support the mother to stay for at least 48 hours, and therefore, the ﬁ rst two visits are taken care of in the institution. However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the\n",

However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the nurse/ANM there. • If the baby is born in a health facility, or at home, you should visit the baby on Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additional visits are needed for newborn babies which are LBW, born before term and are sick. 3. Examining the Newborn at Birth Steps for you to take “just after” the baby is born if the baby is born at home, or if you are present at the delivery, 1. Ask the mother about/observe the ﬂ uid a/g286 er the waters break. 2. If the ﬂ uid is yellow/green, as soon as the head is seen (even before delivery of complete baby), clean the mouth of the baby with gauze piece. 3. As soon as the baby is born, note the time of birth and start counting time. 4. Observation of baby at birth or within the ﬁ rst 30 seconds and at 5 minutes a/g286 er birth for movement of limbs, breathing and crying. The ﬁ gure below will enable the assessment of whether the newborn should be recorded as a live or still birth. All six have to be “No” to declare a still birth. Even if one is “yes” the baby should be declared as live birth. 5. If there is no cry or a weak cry, if there is no breathing or weak breathing or gasping, this condition is called Asphyxia. If the baby is asphyxiated (does not breathe at birth), and there is no doctor or nurse, you should try to help and this skill is taught to you, in Module 7. However, in many such newborns, your eﬀ orts may not make enough diﬀ erence and you should not feel bad or blame yourself for this. (Management of asphyxia will be taught in Module 7).

The room should be free from strong wind. 8. You should weigh the newborn and decide whether the baby is normal or LBW. 9. Determine whether the baby is term or pre-term. 10. Measure newborn temperature. First examination of newborn a. You should conduct the first examination within first 24 hours of delivery and look for the following:• Whether the baby has any abnormality such as curved limbs, jaundice, bump on head, cle/g286 lip. • How the baby is suckling at the breast. PAGE 317 Part C Newborn Health 47• Whether the baby has loose limbs. • Listen to the cry of the baby. • Provide care of eyes. If there is pus/purulent discharge from eyes and no doctor or nurse available, apply tetracycline ointment. Even for normal eyes, tetracycline is used as a preventive, so even in doubt as to whether it is pus, it could be given. • Keep umbilical cord dry and clean. b. General precautions the family must take The newborn is delicate and can easily fall sick if the family and mother are not careful.

Y ou should explain some general precautions that the family should take. • Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not be bathed until the ﬁ rst seven days, many families would like to bathe the baby on the ﬁ rst or second day. For a normal baby, if the family insists, the baby could be bathed a/g286 er the second day. But in the case of LBW baby, you must insist on their waiting for at least seven days. You should explain that bathing the baby and leaving it wet or exposed may cause it to get cold and fall sick. Thus, it is be/g308 er to wipe the baby with a warm wet cloth and dry the baby immediately. • Keep the baby away from people who are sick. • People who are sick with cold, cough, fever, skin infection, diarrhoea, etc. should not hold the baby or come in close contact with the baby. • The newborn baby should not be taken to places where there are other sick children. • The newborn baby should also not be taken to places where there are large gatherings of people. c. What are you expected to do during the newborn visits? • Enquire and ﬁ ll the mother ’s information on home visit form. (Annexe 6) • Enquire and ﬁ ll newborn information on home visit form. These forms help you to think about all the steps you need to take. (Annexe 7) • Take out the necessary equipment from the bag and keep on a clean cloth. • Wash your hands well as taught.• Then examine the baby – a. measure temperature, b. weigh the baby, and c. perform other activities in the sequence provided in the newborn home visit form. (Annexe 8 & 9) • Provide the care of eyes, skin and cord. • Check that the home visit form is ﬁ lled in completely. PAGE 318 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 48d.

Eye care Skill checklist for applying eye ointment If a newborn has pus discharging from its ey es y ou can put antibiotic ointment in the baby’s eyes or a capsule which is available in the market. How to put antibiotic ointment:• Gently pull the baby’s lower eyelid down.• Squeeze a thin line of ointment moving from the inside corner to the outside of the eye. • Do not touch the baby’s eye with the tip of the tube. If the tube touches the babies eyes, it shouldn’t be used again. • If the eyes are swollen with pus, then put the ointment two times a day for 5 days. Remember: The usual bathroom scales cannot reliably record small diﬀ erences in weights. That is why bathroom scales cannot accurately record newborn weight and it is not advisable to use these for weighing newborns. PAGE 320 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 504.

      "about breastfeeding • Start breastfeeding immediately or at least within one hour a/g286 er birth. Give nothing else, not even water. • Baby should be put to the mother’s breast even before placenta is delivered. It is useful for both the baby as well as the mother. • Breastfeed as o/g286 en as the baby wants and for as long as the baby wants. Baby should be breastfed day and night at least 8-10 times in 24 hours. • Feeding more o/g286 en helps in production of more milk. The more the baby sucks, more milk is produced. • Baby should not be given any other liquid or foods such as sugar water, honey, ghu/g308 i, goat’s/cow’s milk and not even water.Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Counsel mother for breastfeeding. • Provide breastfeeding support. • Emphasise importance of early and exclusive breastfeeding.• Help mother to express milk and feed babies who cannot suckle at birth. • Manage breastfeeding problems (engorgement, cracked nipple, mother feels she does not have enough milk).

Counselling tips • You are there to help the mother, not to take over. • Use verbal and non-verbal skills to make her feel at ease. • Encourage and praise her; every mother has the ability to breastfeed. O/g286 en mothers are worried that they are inexperienced and lack the conﬁ dence. Many women do not breastfeed successfully because they do not get good advice, support and encouragement. • If she says something that you do not agree with, do not say ‘that is wrong’. Do not make her feel bad or stupid. You can repeat what she says (For example, ‘I hear you saying that you think you don’t have enough milk....’ Ask her why she thinks so. Listen to what she is saying and why). • A/g286 er you assess the breastfeeding, you should check the baby’s weight gain. • Give advice in simple and clear language. • Make sure the mother understands what you are saying.• Have her repeat what she will try to do. g. Why only breastfeeding? Giving other food or ﬂ uid may harm the baby in following ways• It reduces the amount of breast milk taken by the baby.• It may contain germs from water or on feeding bo/g308 les or utensils.

PAGE 323 Part C Newborn Health 53Managing Common Breastfeeding Problems Sore nipples Causes: poor latch-on or positioning at breast Management • Improve attachment and/or position. • Continue breastfeeding (reduce engorgement if present). • Build mother’s confidence. • Advise her to wash breast once a day; not to use soap for this. • Put a little breast milk on nipples after feeding is finished (to lubricate the nipple) and air-dry. • Wear loose clothing. • If nipples are very red, shiny, flaky, itchy, and their condition does not get better with above treatment, it may be fungus infection. Apply gentian violet paint to nipples after each breastfeed for five days. If the condition does not improve, refer to a doctor. Inverted nipples Sometimes the nipple will retract in to the breast, and can be checked even during pregnancy. The best treatment is to encourage the mother to gently pull out the nipple and roll it, several times in a day. Not enough milk Causes: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding; infrequent feeding; giving fluids other than breast milk; mother’s anxiety, exhaustion, insecurity; inadequate family support. Management • Decide whether there is enough milk or not: /rhombus6 Does the baby pass urine six times or more each day? /rhombus6 Has the baby gained sufficient weight? (During the 1st week there is usually a small weight loss, after that a newborn should gain 150- 200 gm per week.) /rhombus6 Is the baby satisfied after feeds? • Re-assure mother. • If there is not enough milk, have the baby feed more often. • Check breastfeed to observe mother attachment and positioning of the mother and baby. • Encourage rest. Emphasise the mother to drink and eat more. • Praise her and return for follow-up.

If it is not possible, ask the mother to express some milk herself. • If breasts are red and hard, continue to feed often. Use warm compresses and gently massage breasts towards nipple. Take mother’s temperature. If she has fever, mother should visit the doctor. She should continue to breastfeed (from both sides) even if she is taking antibiotics. Expressing milk by hand 1. Wash hands with soap and water. 2. Place a warm compress on the breast for a few minutes if desired.3. Gently massage the breast starting from the chest moving toward the nipple; do this in a circle (near the underarm, and then to the bo/g308 om of the breast etc.), so that all parts of the breast are massaged. 4. Lean forward and support the bo/g308 om of the breast with one hand.5. Hold the areola between thumb and two ﬁ ngers of other hand. Put her hand on the areola above the nipple and the two ﬁ ngers on the areola below the nipple. 6. Press toward the chest (about 1-2 cm) and then squeeze the milk reservoirs beneath the areola (do not squeeze the nipple). 7. Press and release the thumb and ﬁ rst ﬁ nger several times until the milk drips out. Use a clean bo/g308 le or a cup to collect the milk.

Babies have diﬃ culty maintaining their temperature at birth and in the ﬁ rst day of life.They come out wet, and lose heat quickly. If they get cold, they use up energy, and can become sick. LBW and pre-term babies are at greater risk of ge/g308 ing cold. When and why do most newborns get cold?Most newborns lose heat in ﬁ rst minute a/g286 er delivery. They are born wet. If they are le/g286 wet and naked, they lose a lot of heat to the air. A newborn baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head.

If the newborn baby is not properly dried, wrapped, and its head is not kept covered, it can lose 2 to 4 degree Celsius within 10-20 minutes. Example: If the baby’s temperature was 97.7 degree Fahrenheit (36.5 degree Celsius) (normal temperature) at the time of birth and if there was a loss of 2.7 degree Fahrenheit because the baby was not properly dried and covered, the body temperature will become 95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), which is below normal.

Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the child.

Note Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.

Skill in AnalysisBasedupontherepliestothesequestions,youwillformanunderstandingofthemultiplecausesofmalnutritioninthatspeciﬁcchild.Itisneveronefactor, Given below are examples of understanding that ASHA formed in two children: Banu was a nine month old girl with moderate malnutrition. She is being breastfed and only this month was started on complementary food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations from there. Her immunisation is on schedule. Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has no odema, but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite. He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. His immunisation schedule is complete.

One of the key components of the mission is creating a band of female health volunteers, appropriately named “Accredited Social Health Activist” (ASHA) ineach village within the identified States. These ASHAs would act as a ‘bridge’between the rural people and health service outlets and would play a centralrole, in achieving national health and population policy goals. ASHAs are to be selected by community, out of residents within the community. They would work on voluntary basis, although compensation would be providedto them for specific activities and services. ASHA guidelines clearly lay downthe accountability mechanisms. The induction training for ASHA would becompleted in 23 days spread in five rounds over a period of 12 months to befollowed by periodic re-training for about two days once every alternate month. Equipping ASHAs with knowledge and skills required to perform the assigned roles will be crucial element in the programme.

They depend on land and farming. Some of them also work as wage labourers innearby towns. In many villages, rearing cattle is a source of income. Most farmersdepend upon rains. Many work as artisans. They work hard to live their life. Some people are too poor. They are grouped as below poverty line (BPL) as per Government criteria. Often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and othermarginalized groups. Families belonging to BPL are eligible for special benefitsunder government schemes. A village may have different settlements fordifferent castes. Everyone needs health care. Yet some groups of people are vulnerable to sickness. The poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people needhealth care more often. Their health needs are not adequately met. They havelittle or no money. At times they have to take loans at very high interest rates to 3 PAGE 14 get admission in hospitals or to buy medicines for their kids. Your role is to guide them to get good care in time and that is affordable. Village people have a practical sense of solving problems with simple resources. Thus they should be involved in village health planning to assesshealth needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address thecommon problems. Schools, fair price shops, water, electricity, seeds, fertilizers, credit, animal care, bus/jeep, roads, employment, forest produce, common grazing grounds, post-office, haat—we need all these services in the village. Health care is just onemore. It is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village. As ASHA, youshall do your best to help your own people in their struggle for health and sharejoys of life.

It means healthy body is the most important pleasure of life. Good health leads to productive, happy, and a long life. Both the body and mind need to be healthy. And our relation withthe society should also be healthy. People often think healthis linked to medicines, doctors and hospitals only. This is notalways true. Hospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. But first we need to take care of our body. You can preventdiseases, promote health and prolong life. We say Aarogyam dhansampada. This means health is real wealth. Health makes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. Ill health keeps us away from work and livelihood. Ill health means spending on doctors andmedicines. In villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle topay for hospital expenses. The money people spend on tobacco and liquoralso causes ill health. Following health practices protect our wealth andincrease productivity. 4 In this lesson we will learn about What is health? What make us healthy?What leads to ill health?How health and ill health assessed? PAGE 22 HHooww ttoo rreemmaaiinn hheeaalltthhyy?? Some parental gifts make part of one’s health. Like body features, frame, height, weight, looks, skin and color, some mental traits etc. Sometimes we even get some health problems linked to parental gifts.

Healthiness shows up in happiness. But we often use ‘measures’ for health. When selecting young men/women for police or army, parameters such as height, weight, chest circumference etc are used. We also use several tests(eyes, blood, urine etc) to test assess health of an individual. We can talk of ill health in similar ways. We relate ill health to illnesses—cough, fever, diarrhea, TB, polio, drunkenness etc. At the level of community we usesimilar words. For instance, we say there are more people having fever this yearthan the last year, or fewer people with diarrhea or no case of AIDS in thisvillage. Or more infants dying in this village as compared to other village. Some examples of how we discuss health and ill health in the village: /square6This year we have more/fewer fevers in the village. /square6How many TB patients in the village? /square6Mother and Child deaths in the village in last year. /square6Number of underweight babies in the village. /square6Number of teenage girls giving birth to babies. /square6Number of smokers and', 'village. /square6How many TB patients in the village? /square6Mother and Child deaths in the village in last year. /square6Number of underweight babies in the village. /square6Number of teenage girls giving birth to babies. /square6Number of smokers and alcoholics in village. /square6Mental attributes-are people happy, number of suicides etc. You can make our own checklist based on our situation and needs.

These are convenient for young girls,women, aged, sick person and children who often find it difficult to go tofields.

Apply soap or ashes and rub on the hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. Again, pourwater. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin. Cutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned. PAGE 26 OOuurr MMoouutthh aanndd tteeeetthh Our teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in the tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums. We must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine whathappens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and notcleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we don’t clean our mouth aftermeals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash. Discourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. That causes stains. Smoking also makes teeth dirty.

Do not dip hands in the water container. Remember your hands may be dirty. Children are often in habit of taking water from vessel by dipping their handsespecially after play. Use a ladle (handle-cup) instead. We can also make water safer by boiling it for about 15-20 minutes after therolling starts. Chlorine addition is just one way of making water safe. Overnight storageof water makes it practically safe.Boiling is good, but also needs fuel. If you have chlorine drops, add 2 drops in one bucket. Use this water after keepinghalf hour. If you have no chlorine drops, we canmake a stock solution from bleaching powder. Take one liter water in a jar. Add a teaspoonful of well-kept bleaching powder to it. Usually bleaching powder is available withMPW or Nursedidi. Stir it well and keep it still for five minutes. Pour thesolution into a plastic bottle using a strainer. Keep off the un-dissolvedpowder. Cap the bottle and you can use it for 2 days. Take 5 ml (in a big23 WATER SAFETY AT HOME PAGE 30 spoon) and add to one bucket of water and stir it well. Use the water after half an hour.

Together they make the human body. Different organs doing different work are linked together as organ systems. Various systems do various tasksnecessary for life. So we have systems for breathing, bloodcirculation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. And all the bodysystems work in cooperation. The body has control systems for this, viz brain,nerves and hormones. Bones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement possible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of differentshapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints makemovement possible. Hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. Andjoints are so different.Body Mapping and Overview of OrgansBody Mapping andOverview of Organs 9 In this lesson we will learn about Different organs of our body, mapping organs on the bodyand about which organdoes what. PAGE 40 You may have seen the guts of sheep or chicken. Human gut is about 22 ft long- more than a room length. Gut is part of the digestive system and digests/absorbs food. While passing through, food will be mixed with secretions from different glands. It also throws off the waste. Whatever body cannot put to use in sent in large intestine and later leaves body through anal opening. Digestion gives us energy to work and nutrients to build and repair the body. Respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let out. Oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy. We have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body. This goes in rounds thanks to our heart pumping each second.

The heart keepsyour blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs andnutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body.Younger you are faster is your heart beat. The blood carries nutrients andoxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks andwagons in the body, through the vessels. Urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat.Reproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction and continuation of life on earth. We know the world through our five windows. We call them sense organs. The eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure,vibration and pain. Thanks to the Nervous system, we respond to these signals. Human brain is most complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or changealertness. This is necessary for our survival. The Nervous system controls severalbody functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.34 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 41 MMaappppiinngg aanndd lleeaarrnniinngg mmoorree aabboouutt oouurr bbooddyy Some of our organs are seen from outside like eyes, ears, breasts, testes.

Soft organs are inside thechest and abdomen. Brain is inside the skull. A butterfly like important gland (Thyroid) is present in front of the neck. Goitre is actually a swelling of this. Iodized salt prevents it. When we take a deep breath the chest expands. The lungs inside the chest and fill like balloons. The wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs.It indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk. Fear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times in a minute. We can feel the beats pounding in the chest. Put an ear to yourfriend’s chest.', 'windpipe in the place of trunk. Fear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times in a minute. We can feel the beats pounding in the chest. Put an ear to yourfriend’s chest. Can you hear heart beats? Where is it? Heart is just left of themiddle of the chest. Pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of thebody. These carry blood from heart to all parts. Can you see the veins under yourskin? Blood is brought back to heart through veins. Let us drink a glass of cold water. Do you feel it going down from throat to stomach? Food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upperabdomen. Stomach stores and digests food for 1-2 hours. Then the food passesdown the gut. Do you feel the rumbling in abdomen when you are hungry? A long coil of gut is in the middle of abdomen. This does further digestion. The long coils lead toa wider short pipe called colon. The well known appendix sits on the colon onlower right corner. Appendix does not serve any special purpose in the body. Colon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen walls– going up from lower right side, and then becomes horizontal going left. Then it goes down to the bagstoring waste. Finally it reaches the anus. Liver is high up on the right side. A swollen liver can be felt below the lower right ribs. Similarly on the left side we have a small spleen. In some diseasessuch as Malaria, spleen becomes very big. We can feel it below the left side ribs.35 BODY MAPPING AND OVERVIEW OF ORGANS PAGE 42 Two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of abdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes. One feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time.

In women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus –the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in thelower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones. The womb grows inpregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the wombon the abdomen. Two egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. The tubes have free finger like ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovariesflank the uterus. Outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women.In men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the end of a long muscular penis. In women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. Inner vulva is soft tags of flesh. These are aptly called inner lips of vulva. The inner lips are connectedabove at clitoris. Clitoris is small external bud like organ. A fleshy cushion ofvulva–called outer lips–protect all these parts. The vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. Hymen, a thin sheet with holes covers the vaginal opening. This may be torn after puberty. Afterpuberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. Breasts also grow in women atthe age of maturity. At maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.36 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 43 Many young boys and girls are unawares of these differences.

Fetching water and firewood take many hours of hard work by women. Tedious work in farm can lead to health problems. Women work hard but get lower wages. Women get less food at home. In fact they eat at the end when every one in the family has eaten. Most women are anemic andweak. Their weights are too low to be healthy. Women are given less opportunity for education.Women have less say in decisions in the family.Women and Health 10 In this lesson we will learn about Why women suffer more ill health and neglect Attitudes of society on women’s health PAGE 45 Many men women treat women badly, and even beat them.

It is good to select a venue which is accessible to all especially women from scheduled castes/ tribes are comfortable. It is useful to select a house, which already have a sanitary latrine. You need to communicate to people in advance about the venue and timing of this meeting. You can also talk with members of self help group in the village. 11 In this lesson we will learn about How to organize a group meeting PAGE 48 We can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. Just provide the beginning or let someone begin. Gradually other members of group will also start participating in the discussion and share their problems. If we have a model or flip chart about sanitary latrine, we can share it now. If someone in the village has got a sanitary latrine to a smokeless one, that can be a demonstration. Explain the basics of the sanitary latrine, and how one can make it. A good flip chart will have all that explained in pictures. Discuss ways of how Panchayat can help families in constructing sanitary latrines and what assistance is available.

Each PHC has 5-6 sub centres and serves 25000-30000 population. Eachvillage falls under one of them. Have you ever been to the PHC? A PHC has 1-2 doctors, nurses, compounder and other staff. With its 4-6 subcenters the PHC’s main activity is for preventing diseases, promoting healthand treatment of illnesses. Here are the main activities: National health programmes related to Women and child health, malaria, filariasis, TB, Leprosy, Blindness, sexually transmitted infections and HIV-AIDS.Some specific activities are: /square6Immunization against six diseases. /square6Health services for pregnancy, childbirth and after. /square6Health check up and treatment of school children. /square6Control of disease outbreaks- like diarrhea. /square6Treatment of diseases. /square6Birth spacing and sterilization, early and safe abortions. /square6Health education to promote health and prevent illnesses. /square6Camps for disease detection and treatment, sterilization etc. /square6Health care during of haats and melas. /square6Medico-legal work.46 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 53 The PHC doctor has many tasks to do.

But some illnesses cause a scar inside the body. TB is one example. It leaves a scar in the lungs after cure. Some illnesses have a cause in the mind–mental illnesses. Healing is a natural process. Good nutrition and immunity help healing. Healing leads to cure. And most illnesses heal. But some can get worse as they have no cures. Can you name some diseases with no cure. GGeerrmmss,, wwoorrmmss,, iinnsseeccttss--iillllnneesssseess aanndd iimmmmuunniittyy Most of the common illnesses are due to germs, small insects and worms. We can often see worms in the excreta.

Examples of germ illnesses are: Malaria, chickenpox TB, measles, leprosy, many types of diarrheas and dysentery. The gravity and period of illness vary with thegerm-type and our resistance to that germ. Immunity is the resistance of our body to fight germs. Immunity develops as body gets experience of fighting germs. Immunity helps us recover from a germ-illness. Immunity may be natural like in leprosy.

Unsafe abortions through illegal providers (quack or doctor) are riskier than childbirth. Abortions can also cause infection and sterility. In India abortion is legal and can be obtained on specified grounds. Abortion is available at recognised MTP centers on specified reasons such as Danger to life or risk to physical and mental 18 In this lesson we will learn about The links between childbearing and women’s health.

Condoms also preventsinfections in genital tract of women and men. Condom should be removedcarefully after each intercourse to avoid leakage. If not used properly thismethod may fail. IuDis a device used for spacing. It is inserted in the uterus. Doctor or nurse puts an IUD in uterus after proper examination. This method is most reliable. Proper selection of a woman is necessary for IUD. There areother temporary contraceptives available for regulating interval betweentwo births.

Breast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. No other feeds including water are necessary. Consult a Nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeedingproblem even after your help. Mother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. On delivery the breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. The baby should befed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ-attacks. This should not be thrown away. Breast milk provides for all the needs of the baby.

Snakebites are common in rainy seasons and night hours. Two-fang marks are typical of a poisonous snakebite. Look for fang marks. It is easy to know the 4 common poisonous snakes. Cobra, krait, big viper and thesmall viper are the four main harmful snakes. Effective and quick first aid can save most patients. No magic or temple prayers can undo the poison bites. The 90% cases are saved because the bite was non-poisonous. Panic can also kill. Drooping eyes or bleeding are first signs of poison. Drooping eyelids or sleepiness point to cobra and krait bites. Bleeding from bite, gums, urine, in vomit means viper bite.Snake BiteSnake Bite 29 In this lesson we will learn about How to identify poisonous bite What is the correct first aid for snakebite?

You know that by the time a girl reaches the age of 10-13 years, a number of changes occur in her body preparing her to meet the complex child birth process. The normal menstrual cycle has the following characteristics: blood & tissue being lost through the cervix & vaginacervix (neck of uterus)uterus vaginaovary developing egg (ovum) fallopian tube egg has not been fertilized lining of uterus not needed to grow a baby PAGE 110 9 A woman can become pregnant from the age of 13-16 (when her periods begin), up to 45-55 years, (when they ultimately stops). When they stops it is called menopause. If the pattern of menstruation is different from that given above or there is bleeding again after menopause or the bleeding continues after 55 years of age a woman must consult a doctor. A girl or woman should consult a doctor if: \\uf06e bleeding lasts for more than six days \\uf06e there is too much bleeding especially clots \\uf06e there is bleeding in between the cycle \\uf06e there is pain during menstruation \\uf06e there is infrequent bleeding \\uf06e there is bleeding during sexual activity How reproduction occurs All females produce “egg” and males produce “sperms” which unite inside the womb of the woman and produce a foetus. This grows into a baby. The sex of the baby is', 'during sexual activity How reproduction occurs All females produce “egg” and males produce “sperms” which unite inside the womb of the woman and produce a foetus. This grows into a baby. The sex of the baby is determined by sex chromosomes, through which we inherit our parents’ traits. A woman’s egg has X chromosome and a man’s sperm has either X or Y chromosome (which we may call girl sperm or boy sperm respectively). At the time of fertilization, the X male chromosome of female egg meets either a girl sperm (XX) resulting in a baby girl or a boy sperm (XY) resulting in baby boy. Neither the man nor the woman can do MENSTRUATION AND FERTILITY ManSperm EggWomanSperm enters the egg and unites with itFoetus, which grows into a baby PAGE 111 10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA anything to make sure that either a boy or girl is born – this happens completely by chance inside the woman’s body depending on whether a boy-sperm (XY) or girl-sperm (XX) meet with the egg. Hence it is wrong to blame a woman for not giving birth to a baby boy, as is generally done. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: As ASHA, you may come across some couples in your village who have no children, or the woman is unable to get pregnant after one or two abortions. If the woman is 20 years of age or above and has been living with her husband for two years, leading a normal marital life but has not become pregnant, advise the couple to consult a nurse or directly go for a check-up to a doctor. Both partners must go together for infertility treatment as either or both of them may be having some problem, which needs treatment. Please note that couples often live apart because one of them has migrated in search of a job. It may be difficult for such couples to have a baby. It is also possible that women are being blamed for having only girls. Some women may be deserted by their husbands and families for not producing a son. You should clearly communicate the role of men and women in deciding the sex of a baby. PAGE 112 Care during Pregnancy3 Pregnancy is', 'may be deserted by their husbands and families for not producing a son. You should clearly communicate the role of men and women in deciding the sex of a baby. PAGE 112 Care during Pregnancy3 Pregnancy is a natural event in the life of women of reproductive age group. However, during pregnancy and childbirth some problems may arise which can threaten the life of the mother, baby or both. It is possible to identify women with some problems quite early if they have routine ante-natal check-up. This will enable them to access specialist care. Care during pregnancy is important to monitor progress and growth of the baby, detect complications at the earliest and treat them accordingly. During the visit the woman and her family should be advised proper nutrition, rest, exercise. They can make plans about where to deliver. This will help both the woman and baby to have a happy and healthy outcome. Minor ailments of pregnancy (e.g. vomiting, heart burn, constipation, backache etc.) are looked after during ANC. PregnancySchedule of pregnancy care \\uf06e The first visit is recommended as soon as the woman feels that she is pregnant This is called registration of pregnancy, which ensures that all pregnant women receive care throughout pregnancy. \\uf06e In villages/districts where female foetuses are being eliminated before birth, it is further important that pregnancy is registered early.

PAGE 124 Unsafe Abortions & Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) 6 You know that sometimes unwanted pregnancies occur. In such cases, the family or woman may want to abort the pregnancy. For this termination, pregnant women often go to untrained persons, dais etc. The methods employed by them for termination are not safe and the facilities are unhygienic. Hence, there is a great risk to the life of these women. You can educate such women with unwanted pregnancies about the dangers of these illegal, unsafe abortions. Such women should be able to confirm whether they are pregnant and if so, they can seek safe and legal abortion at a government health centre or government approved private hospital. Abortions have been legalized since 1971 under certain conditions, as given in under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (“MTP” Act). Such abortions can be carried out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy. Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks (2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to go a', 'out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy. Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks (2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to go a hospital. Abortions done early in pregnancy are also safer than those carried out later. Hence, the woman should not wait till her pregnancy has advanced. PAGE 125 24 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA As per PNDT Act, 1. Detection of sex of foetus during pregnancy is illegal. 2. Termination of pregnancy after identifying the sex of the foetus as female is also illegal. There are two methods of terminating the pregnancy: Surgical abortion This is carried out by evacuating the embryo either using a hand held syringe or electric suction machine Medical abortion This is carried out by using pills In both cases, it has to be done by a qualified doctor in any approved centre. Women undergoing MTP can get more details from PHC. There are advantages/disadvantages of both methods. In both cases, there has to be post-abortal care for the women undergoing MTP. Post-abortal care \\uf06e Follow up after abortion is a must especially after the tablets are given for medical abortion. \\uf06e If the woman has any of the following symptoms, she should be immediately referred to the nearest functional FRU/District hospital. \\uf06c Severe bleeding or foul smelling discharge from uterus \\uf06c Severe pain in abdomen \\uf06c Fever \\uf06c Swelling in the abdomen or severe vomiting Counselling of the women will help them to seek safe abortions which will help in decreasing deaths among pregnant women. After an induced abortion, a woman can become pregnant again within six weeks. Hence, it is advisable for the woman (and her partner) to be counselled for appropriate contraception and help them to get the suitable contraceptive if they wish to adopt.It is important to remember: \\uf06e Termination of pregnancy below 20 weeks is legal under provision of MTP Act.

PAGE 127 Immunization 7 Immunization is one of the most well-known and cost effective methods of preventing diseases. Though most of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) are controlled by now, immunization has to be sustained, not only to prevent VPDs, but also a) to eliminate Tetanus, b) reduce the incidence of Measles and c) eradicate Poliomyelitis. The six vaccine preventable diseases are DPT Immunization\\uf06e Tetanus \\uf06e Poliomyelitis \\uf06e Diphtheria \\uf06e Pertussis (whooping cough) \\uf06e Measles \\uf06e Childhood tuberculosis The vaccines must be given at the right age, right dose, right interval and the full course must be completed to ensure the best possible protection to the child against these diseases. The schedule that tells us when and how many doses of each vaccine are to be given is called immunization schedule.

PAGE 130 Diarrhoea 8 Diarrhoea is defined as passage of liquid or watery stools. These watery stools are usually passed more than three times in a day. Passage of even one large watery motion among children can be labelled as diarrhoea. Normally there are three types of diarrhoea: \\uf06e Acute watery diarrhoea starts suddenly and may continue for a number of days but not more than 14 days. Most of these are self-limiting and will last for three to seven days. \\uf06e Dysentery is diarrhoea with visible blood in stools. \\uf06e Persistent diarrhoea begins acutely but is of unusually long duration i.e. lasting more than 14 days. Diarrhoeal diseases are a major cause of death and disease among children under five years. Majority of the deaths in diarrhoea are due to dehydration (loss of water and minerals).

Some mild fevers subside without any treatment/treatment at home e.g. fever with no cough/running nose/ear discharge/with no rash/without diarrhoea/without any obvious infection etc. However, in many children it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness. For fever in children a blood smear examination should be done. Temperature and fever Our body is warm both in summer and winter. When it is very hot outside, our body perspires. It releases water and cools like an earthen pot. When it is very cold outside our body shivers to generate heat. In all seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all its functions. The normal body temperature is just above 36 0C or 980F. After an attack by', 'very cold outside our body shivers to generate heat. In all seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all its functions. The normal body temperature is just above 36 0C or 980F. After an attack by germs, our body works very fast. It generates more heat and hence fever. But excess fever may be harmful and lead to several complications. PAGE 141 40 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Measuring fever in adults It is wise to take a sick person’s temperature even if she/he does not mention about having fever. Touch your own forehead and the person’s forehead with both sides of your hand. If the person’s forehead is warmer than yours, she/he may have fever. This is a simple way to find out if someone has fever or not. Thermometer is used for measuring temperature \\uf06e Take a simple oral thermometer and shake it well. See that its mercury mark is below normal (36°C or 98.4°F). Do not hold or touch the bulb of the thermometer. Hold the thermometer by the bigger end with no mercury because mercury line will go up and you might get a wrong reading. \\uf06e Put the thermometer’s bulb end under the tongue in the patient’s mouth or armpit for two minutes. \\uf06e The oral temperature is a bit higher than the armpit. \\uf06e Take it out to see closely while turning it slowly. \\uf06e Record the temperature of a sick person. Is it more than 36°C/98.4°F? \\uf06e Temperature of 37°C–39°C is mild fever. \\uf06e Between 39°C and 40°C is moderate fever. \\uf06e Above 40°C it is high fever (refer any person with high fever after sponging and tablet Paracetamol). \\uf06e Clean it with water after each use. \\uf06e For your information, thermometers have mercury inside which is toxic and hence adequate care should be taken when used for children. Treating Fever General treatment \\uf06e Mild fever generally needs no treatment unless we are thinking of some infections like malaria, TB, pneumonia etc. \\uf06e For moderate fever Paracetamol tablet is the best treatment. One tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. For more details see table PAGE 142 41 on drugs in Book 1. Give tablet Paracetamol for two days. For high fever, tepid water sponging is good', 'treatment. One tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. For more details see table PAGE 142 41 on drugs in Book 1.

If fever doesn’t come down with in two days, refer to the nearest health facility. Sponge the whole body with tepid water. Do not use cold water as it causes shivers. Do not give a blanket. Keep windows open \\uf06e Give enough water and fluids to drink. \\uf06e Light meals like khichadi, daal-rice, curd, dalia are soft and easily digested. \\uf06e Fever is the symptom of a disease. It is not a disease in itself. Paracetamol tablet or syrup is general remedy for fever. It only brings down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not kill the causative germs. For common colds and coughs, Paracetamol or herbal remedies are good enough and no other treatment is necessary. Some home remedies for fever Home remedies soothe the effects of fever. Give her: Gulvel kadha Take a thumb thick piece of Gulvel. Add two-teaspoonful powder of dry ginger. Add 10-12 glasses of water. Boil on slow fire. When three glass full decoction remains, cool it. Give half a glass of freshly made decoction. China grass tea Tea prepared with China grass is a refreshing decoction for someone suffering from simple fever. Specific treatment for illness For illnesses due to various germs we need to give specific medicines. Malaria, pneumonia, TB, etc need specific medicines other than Paracetamol. However viral illnesses have no specific remedies. Virus is a very small germ causing many fever-illnesses. Common cold, flu, dengue, jaundice etc are viral illnesses. Remember several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g., malaria, pneumonia, pus (anywhere) typhoid, TB, kala azar, filariasis, brain fever, HIV/AIDS etc. We will learn about them.

Mother \\uf06e Women with four or more children have greater risk of death during childbirth. \\uf06e Similarly older women have more problems during childbirth. \\uf06e If adolescent girls get married early i.e. before 18 years they start having children too soon. These girls are more likely to have complications or can die during childbirth. Also children born to these mothers have low birth weight and more likely to die in the first year.2 PAGE 154 10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Children \\uf06e If a woman has children too close i.e. less than 36 months interval, her own health and her children’s health suffer. \\uf06e Family with fewer children will be able to take better care of them, including their educational attainments, growth and development. Other benefits \\uf06e Some contraceptives i.e. condoms (both male and female condom) help in protecting against infections of genital tract including HIV/AIDS as well as preventing unwanted pregnancies. \\uf06e Some methods are good to regulate irregular bleeding from uterus. \\uf06e Use of family planning methods will allow women to exercise their right over their own bodies. If they do not wish to have more children then they can use contraceptives with discretion. Different family planning methods Pregnancies are caused by the union of egg produced by the woman and the sperm by the man. The egg (which later grows into a baby after union', 'can use contraceptives with discretion. Different family planning methods Pregnancies are caused by the union of egg produced by the woman and the sperm by the man. The egg (which later grows into a baby after union with the sperm) is produced inside the womb of the woman. When a sexual union between man and woman takes place, sperms released to the vagina of woman swim toward the egg in the womb. Union of egg and one of the sperms results in pregnancy. The walls of the womb provide nourishment to the egg. The egg unites with the sperm and grows into a baby. There are five main types of family planning methods: Barrier methods If the sperm does not reach the egg, pregnancy can be avoided. For e xample, when a man uses a condom, the sperm remains inside the condom only. Therefore, the sperms are not able to reach the egg inside the womb. Thus pregnancy is prevented. ManSperm EggWomanSperm enters the egg and unites with itFetus, which grows into a babyHormonal methods This prevents the woman’s o vary from releasing an egg, make it harder for the sperm to reach the egg, and keep the lining of the womb from supporting a pregnancy. For example Mala N tablets. PAGE 155 11 PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES IUDs These are devices inserted inside the womb. They prevent the egg and s perms from fusing and also prevent implantation. Natural methods These help a woman to know when she is fertile, so that she can avoid h aving sex at that time. Permanent methods These are operations, which prevent a man or a woman to have any more children in future. Barrier methods You will be provided with condoms for distribution to women who need them.

Hormonal methods Oral contraceptive pills Oral contraceptives come in cycle packs of 28 pills. Only the first 21 of them contain hormones. The other seven pills contain iron supplements. One pill has to be taken each day. The iron supplement pills are taken after completing 21 hormone pills. Since most women are anaemic, the iron tablets are also helpful. These pills do not interrupt the sexual activity. Above all, unlike condom, OCP is a woman-controlled contraceptive method. There are several brands available PAGE 157 13 in the market.

How to use OC Start the pill from any of first seven days of start of menstrual bleeding and continue until the pack finishes. Start a new pack again. Taken regularly, the pill is almost 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. These pills do not cause abortion. If a woman forgets a day’s dose she should take both the missed and regular tablets together. But one must not miss it for more than two days. If missed for two days, advise her to take pills as soon as she remembers. She can continue taking the pill each day until the pack is finished and also use a condom for sex until seven hormonal pills are taken in a row. You should always mention about the common side effects of oral contraceptives such as nausea, mild headache, tenderness of breasts, spotting between periods and sometimes-irregular periods. Explain that these side effects are not signs of any serious disease. These usually become less or stop in three months. You should help women in getting examined by ANM/Medical Officer, before starting oral pills. You should give monthly supplies to women who have started oral pills after consultation with ANM/Medical Officer. Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP) Emergency contraceptive pills are pills to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. These pills are taken only in some emergency situations. These pills are especially useful for those women who have been subjected to unprotected sex, slippage or bursting of condoms during sex or sexual violence. These pills are to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sexual exposure preferably within 72 hours. These pills will also not work if the woman is already pregnant. She should take two tablets within an interval of 12 hours. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES Take the first tablet as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex.

These pills are now available at health centres and also at pharmacy shops. No prescription is needed to buy them. They are available as EC pills in the programme. Several commercial and social marketing brands are also available. ECPs, taken as per instructions, provide protection against unwanted pregnancy. Discourage repeated use of ECP and advise for choosing a contraceptive method. ECPs do not protect against infections like STI and HIV/AIDS. Copper-T This is a small T-shaped intra-uterine device (IUD). It is made of pliable plastic with fine copper wire wound around its stem. Two plastic threads hang by its stem. After insertion into the womb, Copper-T stays in place and is effective for a maximum of ten years. Some Copper-T devices available in the market are effective for shorter duration also. How does the Copper-T work? Copper-T works mainly by preventing sperms and egg from meeting. IUD makes it hard for sperm to move through the woman’s reproductive tract and reduces ability of the sperm to fertilize the egg. Possibly it also prevents implantation.

Advise women to have check-up once after one month, then after three months and then once a year. Copper-T cannot be inserted at home because stringent cleanliness is n eeded during Copper-T insertion. The woman can go home immediately a fter putting Copper-T. Women should learn how to check the presence of Copper-T. Sometimes its gets expelled out of the womb. It is easy to learn technique of feeling the nylon threads in vagina. Copper-T cannot escape the womb and go up. It can be easily removed by a nurse with a gentle pull. Some women have pain and bleeding after inserting Copper-T. It stops after few cycles. If the condition does not improve then Copper-T can be removed. There are no after-effects if Copper-T is inserted after six weeks of delivery. Removal Copper-T should be removed after 10 years or earlier if woman wishes to have a child, or when she develops heavy bleeding, lower abdominal pain, or severe backache. You should help women in getting Copper-T removed at an appropriate facility. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES PAGE 160 16 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Natural methods There are also natural ways of preventing pregnancies. However, the woman has to learn many things that happen to her body during the menstrual cycle to adopt this method. Awareness of fertility means that a woman learns how to tell when the fertile period of her menstrual cycle starts and ends. Generally menstrual cycle of a woman lasts for 28 days.

You should know more about standard days method from your ANM. Cervical mucus method The opening of the womb of the woman has a sticky fluid called cervical mucus. Typically the mucus is thin and sticky for two days before and after ovulation, which allows for easy passage of the sperm. This is the fertile period. In other days the mucus is thick, dry and breaks on stretching. These days are infertile. These natural methods need a lot of self-control and have a very high failure rate. Therefore it is advisable to adopt other contraceptive methods that have low failure rate in case the woman does not desire pregnancy.

No hospital stay is necessary. There are two methods for vasectomy \\uf06e Conventional vasectomy \\uf06e No scalpel vasectomy Conventional vasectomy The procedure takes a few minutes and the person can go home in an hour. An experienced doctor uses a scalpel to make a small slit in the scrotum, and finds the vas on each side. The vas is tied and cut to stop the sperms from reaching the semen sac. One stitch is required. No scalpel vasectomy The no-scalpel method uses only a needle puncture to complete the p rocess. No stitch is required.

There are less side effects of NSV as compared to conventional vasectomy. This is a safe and easy method and requires only 10-15 minutes. Men commonly think that vasectomy causes weakness — in work and sexual life. This is not true and there is no evidence about it so far. The testicles are not even touched in vasectomy. It is the testicles that secrete hormones and regulate sexual functions. Vasectomy does not affect this any way. There is a need to popularize vasectomy. Why sometimes pregnancy occurs after vasectomy? After vasectomy three months are needed to make the semen sperm-free. A condom has to be used during this period This point is often ignored by men and conception can take place. Condom use for three months after vasectomy can prevent chances of pregnancy. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES PAGE 164 20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Tubectomy (female sterilization) Tying and cutting the tubes that carry eggs (egg-tubes) is tubectomy. There are several ways of doing this procedure. In many states this operation is done using laparoscope (doorbeen). It blocks the meeting of ovum and sperms. This is a popular sterilization method in India. Two methods of tubectomy Mini-laparotomy is the conventional method This involves opening the abdomen through a small incision and operating by hand. Local anaesthesia is given by injection. The mini-lap method needs hospitalization for two days. It is useful for post-childbirth tubectomy, when the womb is still high in the abdomen and easy to reach. Laparoscopy This involves inserting a laparoscope into the abdomen and applying tight plastic rings on the tubes. Laparoscopy can only be performed when the womb returns to its normal size and position (at least six weeks after childbirth). Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail. Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later if', 'childbirth). Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail. Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later if a tube happens to reopen. In cases of major complications attributable to sterilization, failure and unlikely event of death, you should help in accessing compensation available as per FP insurance scheme. You will get more information from your ANM. Reversing sterilization (recanalization) For all practical purposes, sterilization operations are permanent procedures. But, in unusual circumstances like death of all children, recanalization to join the cut ends of tubes together can be adopted by the couple. But in both men and women, only one in four such procedures succeed. These facilities are available in big hospitals only. PAGE 165 Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) including Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)3 What are RTIs/STIs and how are they spread? Many women suffer sexual infection, including abnormal discharges through the vagina, ulcers and sores in the genital region and pelvic infections. Men also generally have sexual infections. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections of the reproductive organs that are caused by various germs. Though RTIs can occur both in men and women, they are more common in women, because their body structure and functions make it easier for germs to enter. RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Reproductive organs can also get infected because of trauma during delivery, unhygienic practices during delivery and abortions, as well as overgrowth of germs normally found in the vagina. Poor general health, poor genital hygiene and early start of sexual activity are all factors that can make women prone to these infections. Many women suffer from reproductive health problems. Women are more vulnerable to these infections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. sexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk. PAGE 166 22 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Why are these diseases not addressed? Women are usually too shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers.

They have been taught to silently suffer problems related to sex. There is also a fear that if a woman is found to have RTIs, especially STDs, she will be labelled a ‘loose woman’. There is a reluctance to seek medical treatment because of inadequate sex education and less access to medical care. The ‘decision-makers’ at home, like the mother-in-law, would allow a woman to be taken to a health worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems or infertility, but not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal discharge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs. RTIs have been badly neglected because they do not kill the person directly. They usually remain inside a woman’s body, giving her chronic abdominal and back pain or making her infertile. Many women keep on suffering and remain silent. Symptoms of RTIs In woman \\uf06e Abnormal vaginal discharge, which has bad smell and more quantity than usual \\uf06e Ulcers or sores over the external genitals \\uf06e Lower abdominal pain because of pelvic infection In man \\uf06e Discharge from the penis \\uf06e Ulcers The presence of RTIs/STIs could also be indicated in men and women by the presence of: \\uf06c Pain or bleeding during intercourse \\uf06c Painful swelling in the groin \\uf06c Burning pain on passing urine \\uf06c Itching around the genitals Unless treated early, RTIs/STIs can lead to several complications, ranging from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility, to increased risk of HIV infections, ectopic pregnancy, cancer of the cervix and death.

It is not only due to having sex with many but also because many people stay away from homes and families for long periods of time, e.g. truck drivers. Women are more affected by HIV/AIDS in India as this is directly related to her economic and social status and gender inequalities. The existing social and gender norms have great impact on sexual activity and risk behaviour of men and women, which affect women more than men. Women also find it difficult to motivate their partners to use condoms or approach services for treatment of infections. In our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place through the sexual route. There are no “high risk groups” but there are some people who have high-risk behaviour. HIV/AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour. The window period After exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12 weeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period to get an HIV test done. AIDS is the disease AIDS may occur many years after getting HIV positive, but the person is infected during this period.

B oys get erections due to an increase in sex hormones. Erections occur when the penis gets stiff and hard - sometimes for no reason. This is normal. Body will also begin to produce sperm during puberty. This means that during an erection, adolescents may also experience ejaculation. This occurs when semen (made up of sperm and other fluids) is released through the penis. This could happen during sleep. This is called a nocturnal emission or “wet dream.” ADOLESCENCE : THE PERIOD OF GROWING UP PAGE 174 30 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Your responsibilities: \\uf06e Young people may have several questions about their body, sex and sexuality, and how to remain healthy. Sexuality refers to expression of sexual feelings. There is attraction towards opposite sex. They need information, and services. \\uf06e You should inform and help the adolescents in getting services through the nearest government hospital, i.e., for health care and also during pregnancy, institutional delivery, access to contraceptives and services for RTIs/STIs and menstrual problems. \\uf06e Males also need information and advice. \\uf06e You may like to visit schools and talk to the young on these issues. \\uf06e Alternatively, you can plan the visit of nurse didi to come to school and talk to the adolescents. \\uf06e If there are any adolescent groups in the village, you should meet them periodically. You may provide information on health issues and seek their cooperation and support in our health work. You may also be required to go with them to the sub-centre or PHC for health services. \\uf06e Adolescents need support in the community. You can talk to Panchayat members, teachers, parents, local leaders and SHG members to provide information on the subject. \\uf06e You need to find out if Anganwadi Centres run a programme for adolescent girls: called Kishori Shakti Yojana.

PAGE 175 Helping Adolescent Girls to Take Care of Themselves during Menstruation6 Staying clean Generally girls living in small towns and cities use sanitary pads for protection during menstrual period, if they can afford them. These are readymade soft cotton pads worn inside the underwear to catch the blood as it leaves the vagina. These pads should not be reused. Some girls prefer to make their own pads out of folded cloth or wads of cotton. These pads must always be clean and dry when worn. They should be changed several times a day and disposed of by burning outdoors in a large empty tin. If cloth is used, they should be washed well with soap and water and dried in the sun. Sun light is the cheapest disinfectant available in nature. In villages there are certain restrictions imposed on adolescents during menstruation. Those restrictions (Don’ts), which are harmful should be discouraged, such as not taking bath during menstruation or not doing any physical work. It is advisable to wash outer genitals well with water every day to remove any blood that is left. PAGE 176 32 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Changes in bleeding Sometimes, the ovary does not release an egg. When this happens, the body makes less hormone, which can cause changes in how often and how much a woman bleeds. Girls whose monthly bleeding has just begun – or women who have recently stopped breastfeeding – may bleed only every few months, or have very little or too much bleeding. Their cycles usually become more regular with time. Women using hormonal family planning, sometimes have bleeding in the middle of the month. Older women who have not yet gone through menopause may have heavier bleeding or bleed more often than when they were younger. As they get closer to menopause, they may stop having monthly bleeding for a few months and then have it again. Pain with monthly bleeding During monthly bleeding the womb squeezes in order to push out the lining. The squeezing can cause pain', 'they may stop having monthly bleeding for a few months and then have it again. Pain with monthly bleeding During monthly bleeding the womb squeezes in order to push out the lining. The squeezing can cause pain in the lower belly or lower back, sometimes called cramps. The pain may begin before bleeding starts or just after it starts. Tips for taking care \\uf06e Do exercise, walk and run \\uf06e Rub your lower belly. This helps the tight muscles to relax. \\uf06e Fill a plastic bottle or some other container with hot water and place it on your lower belly or lower back. Or, use a thick cloth you have soaked in hot water. \\uf06e Drink tea with ginger. Women in your community may know of other remedies that work for this kind of pain. \\uf06e Take a mild medicine for pain with doctor’s advice. Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) Some women and girls feel uncomfortable one or two weeks before their monthly bleeding begins. They may have one or more of a group of signs that are known as pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). Women who have PMS may notice: \\uf06e Sore breasts \\uf06e A full feeling in the lower belly \\uf06e Constipation (when you cannot pass stool) \\uf06e Feeling extra tired PAGE 177 33 \\uf06e Sore muscles, especially in the lower back or belly \\uf06e A change in the wetness of the vagina \\uf06e Oiliness or spots (pimples) on the face \\uf06e Feelings that are especially strong or hard to control \\uf06e Craving for certain foods and increased hunger and thirst. Many women have at least one of these signs each month and some women may have all of them. A woman may have different signs from one month to the next. For many women, the days before the start of their bleeding is a time of unrest. But some women say they feel more creative and able to get things done. These symptoms disappear within a few days after the start of the menstrual period. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: Advise to \\uf06e Eat less salt.

Dog bite is greatly feared because it can give rise to a deadly illness, which is called rabies. This is an illness, which affects the brain. The victim fears water. This is due to severe spasm during swallowing. No cure is available for rabies. Anti Ra bies Va', 'a deadly illness, which is called rabies. This is an illness, which affects the brain. The victim fears water. This is due to severe spasm during swallowing. No cure is available for rabies. Anti Ra bies Va ccine (ARV) immediately after the dog bite can prevent the fatal illness. These vaccines are available in government hospitals. Not all dogs are rabid. Germs are present in the saliva of infected dogs. Some dogs get the infection from wild animals such as wolf or tiger. The infected dog passes it on to the other dogs. All infected animals finally die and may infect others in the meantime. Controlling stray dogs is the key to prevent rabies. Monkeys and other animals can also be infectious if they are rabid due to such bites. Very effective and simple first aid for any dog bite is to: \\uf06e Wash the wound with soap and water thoroughly. This is most important. \\uf06e Do not disturb the wound. Leave it open. Tie a loose dressing and advise to consult doctor/other staff in hospital. 5 Dog and Other Animal Bites PAGE 198 19 How dangerous is the bite? People will ask you if the bite is dangerous. A bite can cause illness only if the animal itself is infected. First symptoms of rabies in bitten person may appear early within 10 days or more after the bite. Rabies infection is likely if a pet dog dies within 10 days of the bite or if it shows any signs of rabies. Even a scratch on the skin may give rabies infection. Each wound is important. We can decide the risk of exposure as follows: Mild: Licks on normal skin, scratches without blood, drinking raw milk of s uspect cattle. Moderate: Licks on fresh cuts, scratches with blood oozing, minor wounds f ewer than five, all wounds except those on face, neck, head, palms and fingers. Severe: All bites and scratches with oozing blood on neck, face, palms, f ingers, face and head, Lacerated wounds on any part of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals. If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe. Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The', 'of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals. If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe. Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The effect of ARV reduces after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite, fresh vaccination is necessary. Rabies in dogs: Abnormal behaviour Identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. Remember that there are two types of rabid dogs - the aggressive and the silent. The aggressive DOG AND OTHER ANIMAL BITES PAGE 199 20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA kind keep biting and attacking humans and animals. They may refuse feeds but bite at wood or iron objects. They look ferocious. There is profuse salivation. Usually rabid animals act strangely. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes restless or irritable or attacking. Their mouth dribbles and froths and this fluid is highly infectious. An originally aggressive dog may turn docile. The silent type languishes to death in neglected places. Wild animals may look friendly and turn to habitations. In case there are such problems in your area these need to be addressed and Gram Panchayats have to play the key role. Immunizing dogs Immunization of dogs is essential. The protection given by vaccines used in the government veterinary services lasts for six months. Protection by newer vaccines lasts for one year. Those who handle dogs also need immunization every six months. A common problem is whether to use the milk of an animal bitten by a suspected dog or animal. The rabies germ is not reported in the milk of animals. It is completely destroyed by boiling, so milk of such animals is not harmful. However, the saliva of the animal will contain germs if infected by rabies. The key issue is to avoid direct contact of saliva of such animals. Your role and responsibilities : \\uf06e Wash the site of bite with soap and water thoroughly. \\uf06e Refer all cases of dog/other animal bites to facility where an anti-rabies vaccine is available. \\uf06e Advise people to get pet dogs vaccinated against rabies.

In some cases, the pressure stove is the culprit. In others it can be gas leak from the cylinder. Children or women may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids — like milk, oil, dal, chai etc. Please note that some of the burn cases can be suicide attempts or attempt to murder. In any case, our priority should be to give first aid and take the person to hospital at the earliest. Inform the doctor about any information by the woman on the burn injury being intentional. In case, you know, do let her know about NGOs or counsellors she can approach for help. As necessary, the doctors will initiate legal measures in these cases. Burns: First Aid6 Common causes \\uf06e Kitchen accidents – commonly bursting of pressure stoves \\uf06e Fire crackers \\uf06e Explosion in work places \\uf06e House fires PAGE 201 22 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\uf06e Chemical burns \\uf06e Electric burns \\uf06e Suicide attempts \\uf06e Murder attempts First aid and other help First try to put out the flames. The immediate first aid for all kinds of burns is to pour plenty of cold water on the affected part, except on acid burns. This helps to reduce damage by absorbing heat from the skin. It also reduces pain to some extent. Water also helps by separating burning clothes from the skin. Many people wrongly believe that water causes blisters on the skin and instead they wrap the victim in blankets. This puts the fire off after some seconds, but does not absorb the heat. Water is far more effective than a blanket because it cools instantly. If you are using water-soaked folds of clothes, place them on the burnt part and change them every three minutes. Help the victim to drink as much water as possible. This helps to overcome the shock caused by fluid loss from the body. Cover the burns with a clean cloth to protect from dust, flies, etc. Unless the burns are minor, all burn cases must be referred to hospitals.

BURNS: FIRST AID PAGE 203 24 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA In this chapter some remedies for AYUSH systems of healing are spelt out. The knowledge about these remedies will be useful for ASHAs for their day-to-day work in community. Iron-deficiency disorders Ayurveda has simple remedies to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia. Use of green leafy vegetables like spinach, Punarnnava , Sigru and fruits like Amalki , Dadim , dry grapes etc. in daily diet is important to prevent blood deficiency. ‘Mandookparni’ fried in ghee is also indicated to increase the RBC. Therapeutically, use of ‘Punarnnavadi mandura’ with water or buttermilk is indicated for minor and moderate anaemia. Anaemia in girls is a common cause for amenorrhoea. Therapeutically use of ‘Rajapravartini Vati’ 500mg. two tabs per day upto the onset of menstruation is beneficial in the condition. Three gms. powder of equal quantity of black tila (sesame), Shunti and ghritakumari (aloe) and one gm. jaggery with tepid water twice a day or decoction of above drugs including jaggery in the dose of 10-20 ml. twice a day is indicated for scanty menstruation. Anaemia caused due to excessive bleeding during menstruation could be managed by the intake of ‘tanduliyaka’ (rice wash) with iron preparations like ‘mandura bhasma’ 0.5 gm, or ‘Punarnavadi mandura’', 'twice a day is indicated for scanty menstruation. Anaemia caused due to excessive bleeding during menstruation could be managed by the intake of ‘tanduliyaka’ (rice wash) with iron preparations like ‘mandura bhasma’ 0.5 gm, or ‘Punarnavadi mandura’ 0.5 gm and ‘Shukti Bhasma’ 0.5 gm. twice daily. Homoeopathic medicines improve absorption and thereby help in iron intake as supplement or from food rich in iron. Commonly used 7 AYUSH PAGE 204 25 homoeopathic medicines for iron deficiency anaemia are given below with their indications. \\uf06e Arsenic album: Anaemia due to malaria, excessive prostration, oedema, violent and irregular palpitation. \\uf06e Calcarea carbonicum: Palpitation & tachycardia, vertigo, anorexia, nausea, eructation; Pale, weak fatigue, lassitude, easily tired; Headache and heaviness at morning, profuse sweating on head. \\uf06e China: Chief remedy for anaemia resulting from loss of fluids, as in lactation or haemorrhage, or from all exhausting discharges, such as menstrual flow, long-lasting diarrhoea. \\uf06e Ferrum metallicum: Paleness of the face and puffiness of the extremities, weakness, easily exhausted. \\uf06e Ferrum phosphoricum: Anaemia and chlorosis; it removes the underlying dyscrasia giving rise to the anaemic or chlorotic conditions and cures the trouble. \\uf06e Kali carbonicum: Anaemia after loss of fluid or vitality; Pallor; Aversion to be alone; Backache, weakness, profuse menses, irregular with clots, weak before menstruation; Backache; Vertigo. \\uf06e Natrum muriaticum: Anaemic and debilitated conditions due to loss of fluids, especially in women who suffer from menstrual disorders. \\uf06e Phosphorus: Anaemia; Morning diarrhoea; Restlessness; Weakness and prostration; Nervousness, debility and trembling; Nausea and vomiting. \\uf06e Pulsatilla: Anaemic condition produced by large or continued doses of iron; System is relaxed and worn out; Patient suffering from gastric and menstrual derangements. Some Unani medicines are also commonly used for supplementing iron in pregnant ladies, mothers and children. Sharbat-e-Faulad 15ml. twice daily is indicated for pregnant ladies and mothers. In children the medicine could be given in the dose of 5 ml. twice daily. Qurs-e-Damvi two tablets with butter is also useful for this purpose. Iron deficiency disorders can be managed as well as prevented by a proper intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.AYUSH PAGE 205 26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Iron rich foods', 'by a proper intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.AYUSH PAGE 205 26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Iron rich foods Green leafy vegetables, spinach, ragi, jaggery, drumstick, dates raisins, amla and figs etc. For enhancing the absorption of iron, one must take whole grams, sprouts, fresh fruits and fresh raw vegetables. Intake of tea, coffee and other preservatives in the food interfere in the absorption of iron. So by avoiding all the beverages, we can enhance the iron absorption. Diseases of gastro-intestinal system Gastro-intestinal system plays an important role in the normal and abnormal states of health. Ayurveda describe that the use of wholesome diet is the only factor that promotes the healthy growth of man. Food should be taken at proper time, when the body feels light after the digestion of previous meals, after the clearance of bowels and urine and when the mind is free from worries. Clean and hygienic food should be taken in optimum quantity. The food should not be too hot or too cold, too heavy or too light. Diseases of the gastro-intestinal system are primarily caused by the food and water that we take. The root causes of many chronic diseases are also related to factors derived from partially digested or undigested food materials. Therefore, the disorders arising from gastro-intestinal tract should be promptly managed. If digestive capacity is low simple remedies like ‘Trikatu’ and ‘Panchakola’ powders 2 gms.twice daily are indicated for use along with warm water before meals. In abdominal pain due to indigestion, Hinguvachadi Churna, Lashunadi Vati, Chitrakadi Vati etc. is indicated in the dose of two tablets twice daily with warm water. Constipation is a common symptom of many illnesses, which can be managed by powder of ‘Triphala’ (equal quantity of fruits of amla, harada and baheda) 5 gms. with tepid water at bedtime. 8-10 dried grapes of bigger variety boiled with about 250 ml. of milk is also indicated at bedtime for relieving constipation.

Theprocess of knowing oneself is continuous and we need to review our strengthsand limitations from time to time, which will help us to change. We need toconstantly grow in our capacities in order to ensure that we are able tofacilitate the process of development and empowerment at the community level too. However before we attempt to empower the community we need to know whether we are empowered ourselves. Remember we were created by nature with a unique body, soul and mind. All human beings have different characteristics and personalities. The externalenvironment influences our personality. As women, directly or indirectly, weare told that ours is a subordinate role. We usually do not question this kind of attitude towards us. In fact, we are not trained to question the daily inequality that we face. We accept the social norms without any questioning.A woman who questions them, is viewed as “out of control.” Let us understand how this attitude affects our personality. In our Indian society a woman is identified by her relationship with others, like that of adaughter, mother, wife, etc. Being brought up in a patriarchal society, a woman internalises these norms, which makes her devalue herself. She does not think of herself as worthwhile and neglects all her needs. All this affectsher self-esteem and overall personality. PAGE 218 6As a woman you must have experienced that you are expected to be humble, to put your needs after that of other people, to learn to say “yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval. This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your journey as an ASHA you', '“yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval. This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your journey as an ASHA you need to first identify your own needs in order to be able to understand and appreciate the needs of others. Let Us Understand the Meaning of Self-Esteem Self-esteem refers to the perception that you have about yourself. It is about how much you value yourself and how important you think you are. zIt is about being confident about and satisfied with your own self. zIt is about a reasonable sense of your self-worth. zIt is about having faith in yourself and your abilities. zIt is about being pleased with yourself and with your achievements. Remember, it is NOT about zConvincing yourself that you are of value zFeeling confident or feeling good when other people praise you zHaving beautiful features Let us examine the characteristics of a person with healthy self-esteem: zSelf-confidence zAbility to express true feelings zAbility to recognise and value own accomplishments zAbility to forgive self and others zAbility to welcome change If you do not take care of yourself, respect who you are and respect your own needs, you will not be able to take care of others and respect their needs. Give some time to know yourself. There is a need to go through the process of self-realisation. It will help you to build up a healthy self-esteem. Maintain a diary about your dealing with others and yourself during the day.The process of understanding the self and self-realisation is continuos and one needs to do it systematically. PAGE 219 7Think about the following questions. Answering them will help you in self- reflection. More questions may be added. zWhat are some of the difficulties that I face in order to complete my work? zWhat are some of the changes which I will practice if I have to deal with this situation again? (The changes can be related to behaviour, way of working, etc.) zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? zWhat did I do today which has made me happy? Remember , each day must contribute to your overall goals in', 'way of working, etc.) zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? zWhat did I do today which has made me happy? Remember , each day must contribute to your overall goals in some way. Each day must in some way be connected to the rest of your life. Each day shouldcontribute to your general welfare, happiness and empowerment. This will also contribute to the development of your community. We have 24 hours in a day, out of which we spend about seven hours sleeping. Out of the remaining17 hours, we need to think about how many we actually spend on self-development. As an ASHA we suggest that you initially need atleast half anhour everyday for yourself in order to grow and develop. You may increasethis period as you get more familiar with this practice. We need to plan for our self-development from today. You may use the tools given here for help.

How will I monitor my self-development plan?Suggestions for monitoring my self-development plan:Review your daily performance as you close the day. Note the efforts you made for self-development as per your plan. If you have not been able todo it, think about the reasons. Reflect on what you will do differently so that you do not come up with these reasons again. Try to maintain a diary and write down the important steps that you have taken to develop yourself, what difficulties you faced and how youovercame them. You may share your self-development plan with a person whom you trust. You may take regular feedback from that person to learn whether she/he has noticed the changes in you. Note: Once you achieve what you had planned, develop a new plan and follow the same steps . PAGE 221 9Some Tips to Achieve your Goal zBe passionate about your goal.

Even if you only improve a little at the beginning it will keep accumulating and eventually become a large amount! zAs an ASHA, demand the best from yourself and from others. Unlike a common person, an excellent person makes great demands on herself/himself. zAs an ASHA you are unique.You are talented and skilled and, therefore, you have been selected to serve the community. Make maximum use of your potential and make sure that you achieve your goals. You need to have astrong will. A strong WILL can move mountains. PAGE 222 10 ASHA as a Health Activist Your role as an activist to improve the access of marginalised and disadvantaged community members to public health care services is very important. Before we discuss your role in detail, let us visualise a situation. Rami lives next to your house. She is five months pregnant. She is very weak, but has not registered her name with the ANM. Rami does not receive any healthcare services. Her husband is a drunkard. Everyday he drinks and shouts at Rami, sometimes even beats her. You feel uncomfortable and want to stop this. You discuss this with other women in your neighbourhood. They understand your point of view. Together you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectivelygo and stop him. You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens again, you', 'your point of view. Together you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectivelygo and stop him. You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens again, you would inform the police. Next day when the ANM (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife) comes, you take Rami with you and register her name. Well, admittedly a real situation does not get handled this smoothly, but you will never know just how it will fare unless you try it out. You need to take the first step towards bringing about change. Initially you will be alone but slowly, with your efforts of creating awareness through one-to-one approachor by addressing the issue in the village meetings you will have many to support you in your endeavour. PAGE 223 11The above effort is an example to explain “activism” As an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist. So it is important to understand how it is done. Read the following real life examples ofactivism. Anti Arrack Movement In 1991, women from Dubagunta, Nellore district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, drove away the liquor contractors from their village. This is said to have been the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor)Movement, which finally led to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on16 January 1995. The main participants in the early struggle were poor rural women, predominantly from scheduled castes and backward classes, supported by voluntary organisations and, later, by politicians from opposition parties. This is not just a story, it actually happened. It is about what a miracle that common women were able to achieve collectively. It is about a communityof hard-working women who laboured in the fields to earn their living.Unfortunately, all their labour was wasted on arrack and toddy (locallymade liquor). The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the hard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), inexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris. After drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making their', 'liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris. After drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making their lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to gostraight to these shops in the evening after returning from work. Theycame home late at night, completely drunk.They would hand over somemoney for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his father to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community was embarrassed when her relatives visited her houseand, to her shame, were scared away from the village by the obscenelanguage of her closest neighbor, a heavy drinker. She felt ashamed andthought that the village would be a much better place without arrack. Everyday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women discussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached the village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders.They expressed their problem and asked them to get r emove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the Sarpanch, although agree able, were unable to do anything PAGE 224 12The next day one hundred of the women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come intothe village’, they told the cart driver strongly in unison and stood in frontof it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them offered him a rupee to doso.The driver got scared and left the village. Then a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded that it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police were called. They said that all those who bid at auctions have theright to sell arrack.The women stood unmoved. They said that they wouldgo to the Collector and will not keep quiet if arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet. They made several plans, butnothing worked and they gave up. These events gave strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and', \"arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet. They made several plans, butnothing worked and they gave up. These events gave strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and struggled strongly to get rid of arrack from theirvillage. The story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of the district. In the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the community through puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They also shared the story of Dubagunta village. Women of other villages had also suffered a lot. There were quarrels every day in their families.They survived only by taking refuge in neighbouringhouses. Daily, for two-three hours they had to put up with this situation.There was not enough food for their children. So, women in other villages considered doing in their village what the women in Dubagunta had done earlier. The members of three literacy centres discussed this issue. Theteachers supported and guided them. Finally, they also attacked the arrackshops. They too managed to stop the arrack business in their village.The women in Dubagunta initiated and led a movement in which women from other villages joined and ultimately the situation changed for the better. Chipko Movement The Chipko Movement was initiated in the Uttarakhand region of India by a group of villagers who opposed the commercial cutting down of trees. Themovement was led by women who were influenced by Mahatma Gandhi. For rural women, saving the environment is crucial to their economic survival. As primary food, fuel and water gatherers, women have strong interests in reversing deforestation, desertification and water pollution.The women made a living in the Himalayan foothills, using its forests assources of food and fuel. They faced a particularly severe challenge in the PAGE 225 131960s, when India, to enhance economic development, started to cut trees to export the wood and earn foreign exchange. As a consequence, the hillsoil washed away, causing landslides, floods and silting in the rivers belowthe hills. Crops and houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies. Against these harmful deforestation policies a\", \"houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies. Against these harmful deforestation policies a movement called Chipko was born. “Chipko” in Hindi means to cling, reflecting the protesters’ maintechnique of throwing their arms around the tree trunks marked to be cut,and refusing to move. In a remote hill town a contractor had been giventhe right by the state to fell 3000 trees for a sporting goods store. The areawas already becoming barren. The women of the village decided to fight against this. When the woodcutters were scheduled to arrive, the men were lured away from the village leaving the women at home, busy withhousehold work. As soon as the woodcutters appeared, the alarm wassounded and the village's female leader, a widow in her 50s, collected 27women and rushed to the forest. The women pleaded with the woodcuttercalling the forest their “maternal home” and explaining the consequences of felling trees. The woodcutters shouted at and abused the women and threatened them with guns. The women in turn threatened to hug themarked trees and die with them. It worked! The frightened labourers leftand the contractor backed off. In 1974, women in a nearby area used thesame tree-hugging technique in order to protest against the clearing oftheir forestlands. Similarly, in your community you may come across several issues that require to be addressed. For example, the anganwadi is not functioning well; childrenand women are not receiving their entitlement of supplementary food; themidday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly. It could be thatwidow pension is not being received in spite of all the required formalitiesbeing completed by the widows of the village. So, to bring change in such situations, some collective action is required. However, activism or protest is not the first step in any process towards change. First, one needs to understand the situation and find out if thingscan be changed through simply drawing the attention of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue. For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter in order to resolve it.\", 'of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue. For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter in order to resolve it. Activism may not always be the best method of changing the world but it can be quite useful under the right circumstances. It gives voice to a cause. Activism is particularly useful/effective when you have many people who are affected with the same issues and the situation needs to be changed. If you PAGE 226 14decide to initiate a movement along with the people to change a situation, first see if there is some organisation or institute working on the same issueand try and seek their support or join them in their efforts. As an ASHA there are Some Key Principles that You Need to Keep in Mind in Activism to Bring about Change 1. Identify and work on the issues that are most crucial and urgent and are affecting the larger community. 2. Involve the people who are affected and ensure that they cooperate with you. 3. Let it be a people’s movement and struggle rather than an individual effort4. Mobilising the community takes time and will be energy consuming. Do not lose patience and hope. PAGE 227 15 Values of ASHA For every individual, values are the central guiding force for all behaviour and attitudes. Culture, experience, education, religion, law, language and media influence values. It is also important to know that values can change. Whileworking on social issues, we are basically working with the attitudes andbehaviours of the community and the programme implementors for a positiveand desired change. Hence, it becomes very important to address the valuesof individuals for social development. Every individual has her/his own values. There is noth ing like right or wrong. Generally, they are received from our parents, our society and oursurroundings. Values shape our personality and identity and are directly connected with our vision of life. They guide us to decide our goal and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are', 'and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are lost and confused. For example, whether to spend time in gossiping or in my work will depend on myvalues. Values remain in the subconscious mind and act like red and green traffic lights.They tell us what we should or should not do. Values are a set of beliefsabout what is good and desirable. They are based on assumptions about how the world works. Our idea of what is the right thing to do in a situation comes from these values. PAGE 228 16Some examples of values which are required for social development include: 1. Value of Equality zIn a patriarchal society women are viewed as submissive, weak and soft and men as strong and powerful. Due to this thinking men are given morerecognition, power and respect in the family and society whereas womenare usually viewed in a supportive role. As a result, girls and woman haveless access to resources. For example, girls and women are given less food than boys and men of the family. Men and boys are given more scope to develop themselves, e.g., men are given more opportunity for basic and higher education. Men, usually inherit the properties of the family, while women usually do not get a share. If you believe in patriarchal values you will not see anything wrong if a woman is ill-treated. If you believe in equality you will respect a woman as a person. zIn our society the structure of caste is very strong and people who arefrom a socially advantaged class are in favour of maintaining status quo.Due to the caste structure, certain people of our society do not getopportunities to develop and get the benefits of the mainstream. As an ASHA we have to first understand problems of the poor and marginalised communities. They need to be educated about their rights andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion. 2. Value of Responsibility zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own', 'andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion. 2. Value of Responsibility zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own health and that of your family and community. You may keep your own house clean and throw garbage in the street, which is not responsible behaviour. As a member of the community you need to throw garbage at the designated place so as to prevent infectious diseases. zThe Sarpanch of your village has the power to make decision for thedevelopment of your village. Many times people misuse this power and use it for their own benefit or benefit of their friends, relatives and/or caste.Being responsible for your own self and to the power you are designated with is very important. No system works effectively if all the designated members do not perform their duties effectively and in a coordinated manner. 3. Believe in People’s Knowledge and Experience All people have experience and knowledge. It needs to be respected and valued while making any decision. Never view people as empty vessels needing PAGE 229 17to be filled with knowledge. They should not be viewed as passive recipients. They need to be active in sharing their views while making decisions. Forexample, if pregnant women are not coming forward to get their namesregistered you will need to find out why they are not coming. Ask them tosuggest strategies to increase registration of pregnant women and how theycould contribute to making the strategy work. 4. Values of Trust When people honour each other, there is a trust established that leads tosynergy, interdependence and mutual respect. Gaining the trust of thosearound you is not a difficult or unachievable task. Trust can be created bysharing feelings, thoughts, views and being transparent. Trust is a glue thatholds people together. Some of the values promoted by Mahatma Gandhi zAlways speak the truth zBelieve in the power of non-violence zA person should not be discriminated against on the basis of her or his caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being. zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness. zNever misuse common resources', 'her or his caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being. zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness. zNever misuse common resources like land, water, forests, wood, etc. Itbelongs to every individual on earth and all should have equal access tothese resources. zYou can touch the heart of people if you are committed to serve them. zKeep people at the centre of your activities and believe in the power ofpeople. It is a fact that people who are conscious of their value-based priorities are more fulfilled and happier in their lives. They make more effective decisionsabout their own and their family and community’s growth and development.To know your personal values is to be more aware of who you are, what you want and what you don’t want. As an ASHA, your work is very important. With that you should also value your family and community. You also need to think about what is more importantto you and why. Answering these questions for yourself can be revealing. Insome situations the family may be important and in some it may be thework. One is actually a means to another. Working together may enable you to support your family, providing you an opportunity to develop. Having a family may provide support to your work. Understanding your values enablesyou to move ahead and maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. PAGE 230 18 Understanding the Human Rights andthe Fundamental Rights Every individual needs to have knowledge about their Human and their Fundamental Rights. Usually we do not come across information on this topic.Also, in the past you may not have discussed this topic with others. As anASHA you need to know about rights. It will help you to learn about your andyour community’s rights. It will also help you to take appropriate decisions forthe development of your community. You may be reading about Fundamental and Human Rights for the first time and you may find the information boring. We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make theinformation simple, interesting and relevant. Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not respect you. These include things', 'We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make theinformation simple, interesting and relevant. Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not respect you. These include things people may have said about you to makeyou feel stupid or silly. For example, some one may have told you, “There is no use talking to you, you will not understand.” Try and remember one or two such hurtful statements/incidents. In 1948, after the global suffering in World War II, all the countries in the world agreed that it would be a more peaceful world if every human beingrespected the dignity of every other human being. As a result, the UniversalHuman Right Declaration came in existence. Our country has also agreed to this Declaration. PAGE 231 19This the set of the Universal Human Rights. zAll human beings are born free and equal. zEveryone should have the same rights and freedom, no matter of what race, sex, or colour she or he may be. It should not matter where wewere born, what language we speak or what religion or political opinions we have, or whether we are rich or poor. zEveryone has the right to live, to be free and to feel safe. zAdult men and women have the right to marry and start a family, without anyone trying to stop them because of their race, country or religion.Both have to agree to the marriage and both have equal rights in getting married, during the marriage, and if and when they decide to end it. zYou may believe what you want to believe, have ideas about right and wrong, and believe in any religion you want, and you may change yourreligion if you want, without interference. The entire list of Human Rights is long and we shall not be discussing it here. Let us now understand what are the Fundamental Rights. The Fundamental Rights As an Indian, our county has granted us six Fundamental Rights. They are: zRight to Equality zRight to Freedom zRight against Exploitation zRight to Freedom of Religion zCultural and Educational Rights zRight to Constitutional Remedies Let us understand these rights in detail. The Right to Equality The state cannot discriminate against a citizen on the', 'Freedom zRight against Exploitation zRight to Freedom of Religion zCultural and Educational Rights zRight to Constitutional Remedies Let us understand these rights in detail. The Right to Equality The state cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of race, caste, sex, religion or place of birth. The state also cannot discriminate againstanyone in matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs.But the Right to Equality specifies certain expectations. The Constitution has a special provision in the form of reserve posts while guaranteeing the Right to Equality. Reserved posts are provided for scheduled castes, scheduled tribesand other backward classes. Similarly, special provisions are provided forwomen and children. The main reason for having these exceptions is that in our society various kinds of inequalities still exist. You must have noticed how people become victims of unequal treatment. Extending such protections does not contradict PAGE 232 20the spirit of the Right to Equality. Such a policy is known as ‘Positive Discrimination’ or a ‘Protective Discrimination’ policy. Right to Freedom The Right to Freedom is a cluster of the following six freedoms: Freedom of speech and expression Freedom to assemble peacefully and without armsFreedom to form associations or unions Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India Freedom to live and settle in any part of IndiaFreedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The aim of the Right to Freedom is the development of a person. She/he should enjoy her/his rights democratically, and She/he should be able to live a healthy and civic life. This right is very crucial for democracy. Right Against Exploitation When we accept everyone as human, we cannot treat anyone as a ‘slave’. She/he cannot be kept in captivity. She/he cannot be forced into labour.Citizens are protected against such exploitation by the law. Earlier there waspractice of bonded or forced labour. Sometimes such traditions were carriedon for generations. The forced labour system has now been abolished. Practice of this system is a crime which is punishable by law. In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and', 'law. In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and is a crime under the Abolition ofChild Labour Act. Right to Freedom of Religion The Right to freedom of religion provides religious freedom to all the citizens of India. All religions are equal before the state and no religion can be given preference over the other by the state. However, religious freedom also has to be observed under certain limitations. The state can regulate the non-religious activities of any religious communityin the interest of public order, morality and health. Cultural and Educational Rights India is a country of multiple religions, languages and cultures. Any community which has a language and script of its own, has the right to conserve and develop them. All minorities, religious or linguistic groups, can set up their PAGE 233 21own educational institutions. In doing so, they may preserve and develop their own culture. Right to Constitutional Remedies This right empowers citizens to approach the court in cases of denial of anyof the Fundamental Rights. The court of law stands as a guard against theviolation of these rights. Under this right, it is the duty of the Judiciary to attend to all complaints pertaining to violation or rights. Directive Principles Apart from these there are some Directive Principles of State Policy that incorporate such rights as are required for the overall development of human kind. zThese Principles include rights like the right to work, right to equal wage for equal work, right to an adequate livelihood, right to free and compulsory education of children up to the age of 14 years etc. zThe state should take measures to preserve the good health of labourersand minor children and to ensure that they are not forced to undertake any work that harms their health. zThe state should promote public health and animal husbandry. zDecentralisation of power should reach the grassroots level. For that, Panchayati Raj must be established. zThe state should protect the academic and economic benefits of theweaker sections. Not only that, various programmes should be undertaken for the development of these people. In addition', 'grassroots level. For that, Panchayati Raj must be established. zThe state should protect the academic and economic benefits of theweaker sections. Not only that, various programmes should be undertaken for the development of these people. In addition to that, free legal assistance should be extended to the economically weaker sections of society to help get them justice. Think about the following statements and decide whether your Human and community’s Fundamental Rights are protected. zMy village is safe and secure. All members of the community receive equaltreatment and information about different government schemes and opportunities so as to avail of these services. zMy village provides all its inhabitants equal access to resources, especially water, irrespective of their caste, sex and religion. zWhenever someone violates the rights of another person, the villagecommittee takes note of it, discusses and takes appropriate decision andaction with the consent of all the committee members, keeping in view the policies and procedures of the committee. PAGE 234 22zAll members of the village are allowed to attend the Gram Panchayat. Are your attending the Gram Panchayat? zNo one in your village is subjected to degrading treatment or punishment. zMy village Panchayat has people from diverse backgrounds, religion andcultures. There are some women members in our Panchayat. There are33% seats reserved in the Panchayat for women. zI can express my political, religious and cultural ideas and beliefs to myfamily and community without fear of discrimination. zMembers of my village actively participate in decision-making processesrelated to village and community development through the village GramSabha. zThe village members and labourers are paid as per minimum wage norms. zBoth men and women are paid equal wages for equal work. PAGE 235 23 Understanding the Meaningof the Rightto Health We have discussed the meaning of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights. This discussion was conducted to have basic information on rights. Now we need to discuss the meaning of the Right to Health. As an ASHA you need tohave knowledge about your right to health. This will help you to mobilise acommunity to access its entitlements and be vigilant. Your understanding ofthe Right to Health will help you to take action to access health care servicesfrom the Public Health System. Let us first understand the meaning of the Right', 'to access its entitlements and be vigilant. Your understanding ofthe Right to Health will help you to take action to access health care servicesfrom the Public Health System. Let us first understand the meaning of the Right to Health. Right to Health Means zThere should be public healthcare facilities in place with adequate amount of drugs and equipment. This facility needs to be functionaland implementing comprehensive and gender sensitive health programmes zHealth facilities and services have to be accessible to everyone without any discrimination. zNobody should be refused treatment on the basis of religion, caste, economic status, gender, etc. zThe public health facility should be located such that it can be reached at the earliest convenience. zThe health services should be affordable for the majority of the people. PAGE 236 24zThe public health services should be available free of cost. zInformation about the services available should be accessible to community members irrespective of their caste/class/religion/sex. They should beaware about their entitlements from the Public Health System. zAll health services should be gender-sensitive and address an individual’slife-cycle needs and requirements. zHealth facilities and services must be scientifically and medicallyappropriate and of good quality. Answer the following questions to know whether or not your community’s rights to health are protected: zIs the health service available free of cost to all the community members through the Public Health System? zDoes your ANM visit your village regularly and visit all the area of yourcommunity to provide free health services? zIs the health facility located at a place which can be reached easily? zIs the health service financially affordable for the majority of the people inthe community? zIs the community aware about all the health services and entitlements that they can avail of from the Public Health System? zIs the community aware of the maternal benefit schemes like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) or any other health schemes being implemented bythe government? If the answers to these questions are “NO”, it means that your community’s Right to Health is not protected. If your community members have to pay for the health services from the Public Health System, their Right to Health is not protected. As an ASHA, if you do not know the answer to the abovementioned questions, get the information', 'members have to pay for the health services from the Public Health System, their Right to Health is not protected. As an ASHA, if you do not know the answer to the abovementioned questions, get the information from the community by discussingthese matters with them. You are a critical link between the community andthe Health Facility. To exercise the community’s Right to Health you alsoneed to monitor, identify gaps and articulate their health care needs to the appropriate health care providers. Therefore, you need to be well aware of the health structure, systems and its operational issues and standards. Different health services are available at various levels. Let us first learn about them. Usually the health services are available at the state, district,cluster and village levels. Village level At the village level there is a Sub-Centre. It provides the following health services under various programmes: PAGE 237 25Reproductive and Child Health Programme (RCH). Under this programme the following services are provided.

Appropriate budgets for those services, materials and human resources are allocated. Quality of care: Now you know about the health services which are available at these different levels. As an ASHA you need to be well-versed with servicesavailable at the Sub-Centre and the PHC. Knowing only about the services isalso not enough. Under the Rural Health Mission great emphasis is being put on the quality of health care. As an ASHA you need to make sure that your community members receive quality health care. There are certain normswhich need to be followed by the health service providers and health careservice institutions provide quality care to patients. Generally, patients do notknow about these. As a result, they often get poor quality services. Quality Health Care is a Right of the Community zA professionally trained and certified person has to take history and examine the patient. zThe patient is to be given appropriate/adequate information related to the diagnosis, treatment procedures and drugs prescribed without scaringor causing undue tension.

It may be a great freedom fighter , a popular politician or a renowned religious guru. All thesepeople have some common qualities, they alter a challenging situation or a problem into an opportunity. Leadership can be defined as mobilising people and resources towards achieving valued goals. Through knowledge and experience most people have the potential to become a leader in any given situation. Effective leadership in the community requires skills like team building, communication, conflict resolution, negotiation and advocacy for change. As an ASHA you often have to play the role of a leader. Hence it is important to understand the meaning of leadership and qualities, which will help you in playing your leadership roles effectively. Leadership means zto be responsible zto inspire people to follow you zto be non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions zto show confidence, assertiveness, enthusiasm, passion and accountability zto have skills for getting things', 'roles effectively. Leadership means zto be responsible zto inspire people to follow you zto be non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions zto show confidence, assertiveness, enthusiasm, passion and accountability zto have skills for getting things done in cooperation with others Leadership PAGE 245 33Gandhiji was a great leader. He took people along with him to achieve freedom for our country. Let us see the principles that he followed as a leader. Courage: Courage to stand up and be accountable for your beliefs and opinions If your community’s Right to Health is violated, as an ASHA you need to have courage to bring it to the notice of the concerned stakeholders. For example,if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting thehouses of socially backward families have courage to tell her that you havenoted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. If she does not listen, be ready to inform the Sarpanch, SHG members and even the medical officer. Continue your efforts till you ensure that she visits all thepeople in your village regularly. Responsibility: Carry out your role and responsibility honestly As a leader you need to be responsible, first person for your self and then foryour community. As an ASHA you are given specific roles and responsibilities.You should inform your community of these. This will prove useful in two ways: zIf they are aware about your roles they will be able to bring it to your notice if you are not performing it effectively. zThey will also support you in carrying out your roles and responsibilitiesmore effectively Encouragement: Invite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care Every individual needs encouragement. As a leader, whenever you meet anyone read the unwritten words on their forehead “I am important.” Encouragement comes by involving community members in the process whenavailing for them their entitlements from the public health system or bygiving them some responsibility to improve the health environment in thecommunity. Improvement: Constantly enhancing your competencies As a leader, an ASHA should constantly improve her knowledge and skills. Be aware of any new decision made regarding the delivery of health services and any new schemes declared. Be', 'thecommunity. Improvement: Constantly enhancing your competencies As a leader, an ASHA should constantly improve her knowledge and skills. Be aware of any new decision made regarding the delivery of health services and any new schemes declared. Be in constant dialogue with the ANM as she is agood source of information. Your skills will improve by practising them. Youmay fail too. From failures you learn what should not be done. If you arerepeating your mistakes it means that you are not learning. By learning youwill be able to stand out. PAGE 246 34Leadership Style People adopt different leadership styles. The two common styles are zAuthoritarian zParticipatory Authoritarian leaders do not come forward for cooperation or collaboration. They are heavily task-oriented people. They expect people to do what they are told without question or debate. They are usually intolerant of what they do not agree with. It is difficult for community members to contribute theirviews or empower themselves under this kind of leadership. A participatory leader creates a positive environment in which all members can reach their highest potential. They encourage the community to reachthe set goals as effectively as possible, while also working tirelessly to strengthen the bonds among various members. They usually form and lead some of the most productive teams. As an ASHA, it is the most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership style. Some of the characteristics of participatory leadership are given below: Leaders establish goals and set the direction As an ASHA you need to articulate what is an achievable goal in your village.You should establish your goal and direction by involving your community as to how, where and when it would be completed. For example, there should not be any maternal death in the coming year in your village, or, All children of your village should be immunised in the next sixmonths. Leaders affirm and articulate values As leaders we need to have certain values like honesty, hardwork,trusteworthiness etc. You have to demonstrate these values in your actions. You may communicate to your community members that you are hardworking but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you. For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be fully immunised.', 'members that you are hardworking but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you. For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be fully immunised. But when the ANM comes for immunisation you are notpresent.Then will people believe that you are a hardworking person? Leaders have high standards and high expectations As an ASHA you should be firm about receiving high quality health care services from the sub-centre and the PHC for your village community. Make sure that the ANM performs her role professionally. As an ASHA you should also provide her support to carry out her role effectively. For example, PAGE 247 35inform the community about the date and place of the health camp or day of visit of the ANM and encourage them to be present at the camp. If the health service provider ill-treats a community member, take a note of it and confront the person concerned. Leaders are accountable and responsible As an ASHA you are accountable, both to the community and the health careprovider. Be an effective link between both of them by sharing information from one end to the other. Some tips to be accountable: zYou will gain personal power and the ability to get results if you assume accountability in all situations, even if you do not immediately see theresults. zComplain only to the person who can do something about it. zConcentrating on blaming others or complaining will reduce your energyand the energy of people around you. zVenting your feelings once or twice is a good stress managementtechnique. Being constantly critical of them has no positive outcome. “Focus on action and not on blame” “If it is to be, it is up to me”“Light a candle instead of cursing the darkness ” Ultimately, you are the one responsible for yourself. You play a crucial part in every situation in your life. What you are today is a result of your choice. This is accountability. Leaders involve others in decision-making As a leader you have to make various decisions. A community leader rarelymakes a decision alone. By law, a decision, which affects the communityneeds to be taken along with the community members. The community needsto feel ownership', 'As a leader you have to make various decisions. A community leader rarelymakes a decision alone. By law, a decision, which affects the communityneeds to be taken along with the community members. The community needsto feel ownership of decisions taken. Only then they will do their best to achieve what they have decided. For example, as an ASHA you have to articulate and assert yourself for your community’s health needs. You need to decide and prioritise the health needsof the community along with community members and jointly develop a planof action. This will encourage them to join hands with you to take necessaryaction. Leaders motivates others To achieve the goal of the Right to Health you need the support of your PAGE 248 36community members, the Panchayat, SHG etc. As a leader, you need to motivate your community to join hands with you. Motivation comes through zBeing in regular contact with them zSharing necessary information regularly zGiving them responsibility zThanking them for their support zGiving them credit for their efforts z Appreciating them honestly in public Leaders achieve unity As a leader you need to promote unity among your community members andbetween the community members and health care providers. Unity can be achieved by listening to everyone’s points of view while taking decisions. Do not make anyone feel neglected since later they may become difficult personsto manage. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership of the goal that you have set as an ASHA for your village. Leaders serve as role models Leaders have followers. Therefore, it is very important that all your actions are responsible. For example, as an ASHA you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the lifeof woman in your village, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if required. Leader listen and explain Listening helps to make the process of decision-making easier and more meaningful. Also, the as a leader you need to articulate and explain your point of view. For example, at the village level families are not proactive in', 'helps to make the process of decision-making easier and more meaningful. Also, the as a leader you need to articulate and explain your point of view. For example, at the village level families are not proactive in preparing for the birth of a child. You need to listen to them about the reasons for theirlack of motivation. Based on their views, explain to them the need for birth preparedness and the likely consequences of poor birth preparedness. Share positive examples where birth preparedness has helped to save a woman’s life. PAGE 249 37Leaders represent the community A leader is the face of the community. As an ASHA, when you discuss the health concerns of your community with the health service provider, you arerepresenting your community. Share their points of view rather than merelyyours. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along with the Panchayat and health and sanitation committee. While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of the poor of your community. Share their feelings and opinions, and make sure that whateverdecision is taken to develop the health plan, reflects their voices. If somesegment of the community has shared that the source of drinking water isnot accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion whiledeveloping a comprehensive health plan for the village. As a leader some of the skills you need to build are zCommunication zDecision-making zNegotiation zCoordination PAGE 250 38 God gave us a mouth and two ears to communicate People failing to communicate create confusion, frustration and problems. Communication is the exchange or two-way flow of information and ideas between two or more persons. Communication is the most important skill to fulfill your role as an ASHA. There are different forms of communication zVerbal communication zNon-verbal communication zWritten communication As an ASHA you need to use all three types of communication. Verbal communication This is the most common mode of communication used. Normally, we think communication is completed once we have orally delivered the message. Butthat is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. Toknow if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/heunderstood the message and take feedback. In short, effective communication is two-way.', 'message. Butthat is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. Toknow if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/heunderstood the message and take feedback. In short, effective communication is two-way. One-way communication is usually not effective. Communication Skills PAGE 251 39Some Tips for Effective Verbal Communication zAccuracy zClarity zCorrectness Points to take care of while communicating: zMaintain eye contact with the person with whom you are talking. zBe confident while communicating. Stand or sit confidently. zStick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time. zBe specific, sincere, honest and direct while communicating zShare feelings while communicating. zBe open-minded. This will help you to understand the other person’s point of view. zYour voice should be loud enough so that everyone can hear you. Your pronunciation should be clear. Use words which are easy to understand. Do not use technical words or jargon. zIf someone has something worth mentioning, give them scope to do so.Never forget to compliment/appreciate others. The speaker is assured that you are listening when you use verbal affirmations like, “I see,” I” agree”, “uh, okay, then….” during the conversation at appropriate points. Non-Verbal Communication We all know that communication is not only about words and languages. Evensilence communicates and eyes talk. Hence, it is important to understandthese forms of communication which are referred to as non-verbalcommunication. Here are some non-verbal behavioural aspects which require extra attention. zEye contact : Looking at the person with whom you are talking is an effective way of declaring that you are sincere/honest about what you aresaying and also communicates confidence. zBody posture : The value or weight of your messages will increase if you face the person, stand or sit appropriately close and hold your head erect. zFacial expressions : Express appropriate feelings on your face. Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions. zGestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. zVoice characteristics : The volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should be well modulated. PAGE 252 40Active Listening is Communication too All of us can hear, but all of us cannot listen. Hearing and listening are not the same. Hearing', 'volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should be well modulated. PAGE 252 40Active Listening is Communication too All of us can hear, but all of us cannot listen. Hearing and listening are not the same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening involves the reception andinterpretation of what is heard. It decodes the sound heard meaningfully.Does a knock on the door sound the same all the time? What if you are aloneand you hear a knock late at night? What happens if you hear a knock whenyou are expecting someone whom you like? Active listening involves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain information, obtain directions, understand others, solve problems, shareinterests, see how the other person feels, or even show support. This type oflistening takes the same amount of, or more, energy than speaking. Itrequires the listener to hear various messages, understand the meaning andthen verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. Following are some of the tips for good listening: zMaintain eye contact zSit or stand in a receptive position, lean forward zEncourage by using positive gestures and words zRemove distractions zUnderstand non-verbal signals zStop talking or doing what you were doing before you began listening zGive time for listening zDo not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking zReflect on the feeling expressed and paraphrase what has been heard zHave patience As an ASHA, keep the following points in mind while communicating with your community. zNever discriminate on the basis of caste and class while communicatingwith the community. Your tone and gesture should not change while talkingto socially and economically disadvantaged community members. Talk tothem with respect and dignity. zA community has immense knowledge and experience. Give people achance to share and use it. Do not treat them like empty vessels. zNever make any comment which emphasises gender inequality. Yourcommunication should be gender-sensitive. zDo not react fast. Listen, assimilate, analyse and then react. PAGE 253 41As an ASHA, you need to keep the following points in mind while communicating with stakeholders zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the', 'mind while communicating with stakeholders zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the necessary information, data and evidence. Never generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not want from them, what you want to change and what you want to continue. zBe calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety. zDo not use a blaming tone. You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will affect those around you. And, of course, confidence and assertiveness will help get your message through. A point to note – think before you speak. Written Communication As an ASHA you would need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You also need to document theprocesses and decisions taken during meetings. Let us first learn how to write simply and effectively. Read the following letter: Dear Sir, There are many women in villages in different areas, which is far away from the place where the ANC clinic is organised. Especially in thesummer season, the women cannot travel long distances to the clinicand hence cannot get their ANC check-ups done. If the clinic can be conducted in two areas on different dates all women can come there and benefit.I request this on behalf of all the community women. Thank you ASHA Village name Do you clearly understand what the letter is about? It is a well-intended effort to bring to the notice of the person concerned the conditions that deprive the village women of the ANC’s services and also PAGE 254 42suggests solutions to overcome this problem. But since it is not clear and specific, it does not seem to be effective. The letter can be made more effective if it includes the following details:Before starting to write an application/letter, every writer should ask1. Do I know what I want to say the (the subject)?2. Do I know to whom I am writing? 3. Do I know why I am writing? Read the same letter given below and see the difference between the first letter and the second. To Date ___________(Name', 'subject)?2. Do I know to whom I am writing? 3. Do I know why I am writing? Read the same letter given below and see the difference between the first letter and the second. To Date ___________(Name and address)___________ ___________ Sub: request to organise MAMTA Day at two locations in the villageDear CDHO (write the name of the concerned person):I am working as ASHA for the village ________ of________ Block. My village has a population of ________ . The houses are scattered across the areas. The ANM regularly comes and organises MAMTA Day. However, it is organised at a place which is not accessible for all the pregnant women. A large number of women living on the other side of the village, are notable to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance. I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the village on different dates. I had a discussion about the same with theANM. She informed me that she needs permission from you. I request you to look into this matter. As an ASHA I take the responsibility to bring all the pregnant women so they have their antenatal check-up. You arewelcome to visit our village. Thank you. Yours sincerely, ASHA (write name of ASHA and the village) PAGE 255 43There are many points to be kept in view in order to convey our messages correctly and precisely. The principles of writing include several do’s anddon’ts Some Do’s1. Address it to the appropriate person2. Check that the letter has a date and reference 3. Keep sentences short 4. Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones5. Do not be vague and mention the reference points for clarity6. Never assume that the reader is aware of the facts and would understand them. 7. Review your writing to add any missing points 8. Write and re-write the letter to get the essence correctly. 9. Explain facts through evidence and examples10.The letter should flow logically from one point to another11.Write with a view to express and not to impress Some Don’ts 1. Avoid unnecessary words 2. Avoid incomplete and irrelevant arguments 3. Do not use ambiguous sentences and universal negatives PAGE 256 44 Each decision that we make has', 'view to express and not to impress Some Don’ts 1. Avoid unnecessary words 2. Avoid incomplete and irrelevant arguments 3. Do not use ambiguous sentences and universal negatives PAGE 256 44 Each decision that we make has a consequence and a level of impact. Even a small decision has the potential to drastically change the course of our lives.All of us can recall some such decisions taken personally or by others whichhave left an important impact. Decision-making is a learned skill and must bepracticed consciously to strengthen it. As an ASHA you would often require to take some decisions, which will effect the community at large. Hence, it is very important for you to master theskill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. There are some basic steps of decision-making which need to be followed: Define the Problem Look at the situation carefully and examine it from all perspectives to find out the actual problem. For example, you have observed frequent occurence of malaria in the village, affecting the basic health status of the people, especially women andchildren. Malaria seems to be the problem and needs to be eradicated.However, the root problem is drainage water coming out of every housecollecting near residential areas and schools. Decision-Making Skills PAGE 257 45To eradicate malaria completely you need to mobilise people and think of solutions to control the drainage problem. Gather Information Once the problem is identified, collect all the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Use allavailable resources in a way to amicably solve this issue. Think of Alternatives At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meetingand discuss the situation with people with whom you have worked with to collect information regarding the problem. You may also present this in the Gram Sabha. What is important is that people accept and understand theproblem. Later, alternative solutions may be suggested. In participatory decision-making, it is very important that the community owns the problem and feels responsible towards solving it. Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a permanent basis. Choose an Alternative Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative from the various options available. This can', 'it. Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a permanent basis. Choose an Alternative Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative from the various options available. This can be done through consensus of thecommunity and approval, of the authorities. To gain consensus and approvalyou would need to discuss it in the village meetings, the Gram Sabha,Panchayat meetings etc. Before selecting the right alternative, assess all available options. It is important to be practical in taking a decision. Put the Decisions to Work An effective decision is one which can be put into action. Thus,implementation is very important. During this process, keep checking if it ismoving towards the expected solution, and if there is something else whichneeds to be addressed. Nobody is an expert in every skill.They can be mastered only through practice. Hence, decision-making skills can also be sharpened throughexperience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. This is part of the learning process. Accepting responsibility foryour actions is a very important quality and a sign of maturity. PAGE 258 46How to Handle Difficult Situations If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue andreview the options. It is also may be a good idea to adjourn and let peoplethink about it overnight. Description of an Effective Decision zAn effective decision should not leave any unhappy feelingamong group members after the meeting has beenadjourned. zAn effective decision can be translated into reality. It shouldnot be decision impossible to put in action. zAn effective decision can be lived with. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature among persons or groups. zAn effective decision must involve the group enough for the members to implement the decision. PAGE 259 47 Although everyone negotiates informally all the time without even being aware of it, formal negotiation is a skill that can be learned throughexperience and practice. People who negotiate a lot tend to be much moreskilled at it than people who have not participated in any formalnegotiation. Negotiation means dealing with differences between two or more individuals or', 'be learned throughexperience and practice. People who negotiate a lot tend to be much moreskilled at it than people who have not participated in any formalnegotiation. Negotiation means dealing with differences between two or more individuals or groups. As an ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these differences to achieve the larger goals of villagehealth programmes. Let us build an understanding of the process ofnegotiation. Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. Because negotiating is an inter-personal process, each negotiating situation is different, and is influenced by each party’s skills, attitudes and style. Weoften look at negotiating as unpleasant because it implies conflict, butnegotiating need not be characterised by bad feelings or angry behavior.Understanding more about the negotiation process allows us to manage ournegotiations with confidence and increases the chance that the outcomes will be positive for both parties. Negotiations need not be confrontational by being offensive, insulting and challenging. In fact, effective negotiation is characterised by groups workingtogether to find a solution, rather than each group trying to WIN at any cost.Negotiation Skills PAGE 260 48Keep in mind that the attitude that you take in a negotiation (e.g, hostile or cooperative) will set the tone for the interaction. If you are confrontational,you will have a fight on your hands. Negotiating is a complex process but definitely one worth mastering. If you keep in mind that you are responsible for the success or failure of the negotiation, and if you follow the tips given here, you will find the process easier. We need to understand that in a successful negotiation everyone wins. The objective should be agreement, not victory or to make the other party orperson feel low. As an ASHA you will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to fulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to negotiate with people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situationwhich requires negotiation. Let us Understand the steps of Successful Negotiation Ask for the other person’s perspective In a negotiating situation', 'people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situationwhich requires negotiation. Let us Understand the steps of Successful Negotiation Ask for the other person’s perspective In a negotiating situation use questions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. Some examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? What are your concerns about what I amsuggesting/asking? When you hear the other person express their needs orconcerns, use appropriate listening responses to make sure you heardcorrectly. State Your needs In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but also why you need it. Prepare options beforehandBefore entering into a negotiating session, prepare some options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not acceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and be prepared to counter the same with an alternative. Do not argueNegotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about trying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation each party tries toprove the other one wrong, no progress is made. Do not waste time in arguing. If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a powerstruggle. PAGE 261 49Consider timing There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on either side, apreoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or tiredness on oneside or the other. The best outcome for almost all negotiations is a win/win situation when both parties walk away with a positive feeling about having achieved their goals. Suggestions for Effective Negotiation While negotiating as an ASHA you must have unlimited patience. Never try tomake the opponent feel low and defeated. Emphathise with the other personto understand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. Approach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right tohave an opinion of', 'your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. Approach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right tohave an opinion of your own.”You may think that this is being soft and noteffective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. PAGE 262 50 Coordination Skills As an ASHA you are a link between health care services and the community. Therefore, you are expected to regularly coordinate with various stakeholders and the community. Aganwadi worker ANM Sarpanch SHG leader Gram mitrasTBAASHA Youth leaderLeader of milk cooperativeSchool teacher PAGE 263 51You need to be aware of different ways of coordination and how to ensure effective coordination.

The most common way of coordination is to meet the concerned person regularly and discuss the issueor share information. Another way of coordination is to call a meeting. Youmay need special skills for effective coordination. Let us understand them. Each meeting needs to be productive. A productive meeting is well-planned and result-oriented. Unproductive meetings are too long, vague in purpose, poorly controlled and frustrating. zDecide the agenda of the meeting. Decide who should be called. Invite only those people who can contribute to the meeting and take follow-upactions. zShare the agenda with the concerned persons. This is very critical. At the village level there may be no need to send a written agenda, However you need to clearly orally inform them about the purpose of the meeting andthe points, which need to be discussed. zAt the beginning of the meeting, welcome all the participants.

In addition, this module includes the development of speciﬁ c competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.

Role of ASHA ASHA is considered to be a healthcare facilitator and provider of a limited range of healthcare services. Health rights would be integral to her work and would be focused in the areas of community mobilisation to improve health status, access to services, and promote people’s participation in health programmes. PART A Didi, which day is the ANM coming to our village? Didi, they are charging me at the govt hospital and I don’t have the money to pay – can you help me?This is the first day of diarrhoea. Do I have go to the far away town or is there something you can suggest?Objectives of this Session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about:• The role of an ASHA and the activities expected of her. • The health outcomes that her work should result in.• The sets of skills that she needs to be eﬀ ective in. • The records that she has to maintain. • The arrangements for her support and supervision. PAGE 278 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 82. Activities of an ASHA ASHA’s work consists mainly of ﬁ ve activities: 1. Home Visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or ﬁ ve days a week, the ASHA should visit the families living in her allo/g308 ed area. Home visits should take place at least once in a month if not more. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, families will come to her when there is a problem and she would not have to go so o/g286 en to their houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/ village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for', 'houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/ village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the house, a series of ﬁ ve visits or more becomes essential. 2. A/g308 ending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide immunisation and other services in the village, ASHA will promote a/g308 endance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM services and helps with service delivery. 3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant woman or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort. The visit could also be to a/g308 end a training programme or review meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit, in others, there would be more. 4. Holding village level meeting of women’s groups, and the Village Health and Sanitation Commi/g308 ee (VHSC), for increasing health awareness and to plan health work. 5. Maintain records which would make her more organised and make her work easier, and help her to plan be/g308 er for the health of the people. The ﬁ rst three relate to facilitation or provision of healthcare and the last two are supportive and mobilisational activities. PAGE 279 Part A Being an ASHA 93. Measurable Outcomes of the ASHA Programme In the course of conducting these ﬁ ve activities, the ASHA should ensure the following: Maternal Health 1. That every pregnant woman and her family receive health information for promotion of appropriate healthcare practices – diet, rest and for increased use of services which would focus on care in pregnancy, delivery, postnatal care and family planning services. 2. That every pregnant woman avails of antenatal care and postnatal care at the monthly health worker clinic/VHND. 3. That every family with a pregnant woman has made a plan and is prepared for the event of childbirth. 4. That every couple that needs contraceptive services is counselled on where to avail of the service. Newborn and Child Health 1. That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286', 'the event of childbirth. 4. That every couple that needs contraceptive services is counselled on where to avail of the service. Newborn and Child Health 1. That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286 en if there are problems and receives essential home-based care as well as appropriate referral for the sick newborn. 2. That every family receives the information and support it needs to access immunisation. 3. That all families with children below the age of two years are counselled and supported for – prevention and management of malnutrition and anaemia and for prevention of illness such as malaria, recurrent diarrhoea and respiratory infection. 4. That every child below ﬁ ve years with diarrhoea, fever, Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and worms, brought to her a/g308 ention is counselled on whether referral is immediately required or whether, given the problems of access to a doctor, ﬁ rst contact curative care with home remedies and drugs in her kit, the child can be managed. Disease Control 1. That those individuals noticed during home visits as having chronic cough or blindness or a skin patch in a high leprosy block are referred to the appropriate centre for further check-up. 2. That those prescribed a long course of drugs for tuberculosis or leprosy or surgery for cataract are followed up and encouraged to take the drugs or go for surgery. 3. That those with fever which could be malaria (or kala – azar) have their blood tested to detect the disease and provide appropriate care/referral. 4. That the village and health authorities are alerted to any outbreak of disease she notes during her visits. Note: Each outcome is not a separate activity. They are part of the protocol followed during a single activity _ the home visit. PAGE 280 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 104.

PAGE 282 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 12For an ASHA to be eﬀ ective in improving people’s access to health services and their health status, an ASHA should: • Have the knowledge and skills to explain the basic maternal and child health services, educate on preventive and promotive aspects of maternal and child health, and provide some measure of immediate relief and advice if there is any illness. • Have the knowledge and skills on other general health issues, especially related to common infections, and be able', 'maternal and child health, and provide some measure of immediate relief and advice if there is any illness. • Have the knowledge and skills on other general health issues, especially related to common infections, and be able to provide information on access to services and preventive and promotive aspects of healthcare. • Be friendly and polite with people and known among community, and establish rapport with the family during household visits. • Be a special friend to the needy, the marginalised, and the less powerful. • Possess the art of listening.• Have the skill of coordination with Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI), AWW and ANM. • Be competent in conducting meetings in the community.• Be motivated and feel happy and rewarded to help community/serve people. • Have a positive a/g308 itude and be keen to learn new skills.5. Qualities that Make an ASHA Effective PAGE 283 Part A Being an ASHA 136. Conducting a Home Visit The purpose of the home visit is to interact with the family, especially the young women of the house, so as to develop a rapport with them, communicate key health messages, support them for be/g308 er healthcare practices, identify illness early and provide appropriate advice. In particular, homes with a pregnant woman, or a woman who had an abortion or delivery within the last one month, or with any child below two or any malnourished child needs regular home visits. The ﬁ rst step is to gather information to understand the situation. You should ask appropriate initial questions, listen to the woman’s response actively, and do not interrupt the woman while she is speaking. Once the mother has ﬁ nished, ask further questions to clarify what she has said. Then seek more information by asking more detailed and probing questions about the duration of illness and the symptoms. The second step a/g286 er listening is to ﬁ rst praise the mother for how she is managing and reinforce the correct actions she is taking. Then make suggestions to the mother/woman on what further she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information. Repeat the key information to make sure that the mother has understood it. You should ask whether the All Visits (Basic communication skills', 'she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information. Repeat the key information to make sure that the mother has understood it. You should ask whether the All Visits (Basic communication skills to create friendly environment) • Greeting. • Explain why she is visiting today. • Act in a way so family feels they can confide in her. • Speak in a gentle tone. • Use simple words in local language. • Be respectful. • Praise what the woman is doing correctly and build up her self-confidence. • Point out why you are discouraging some health practices; do not merely condemn it or brand it as bad, superstition etc. • Ask, don’t tell. • Check if the woman has any questions. • Answer in simple language. • Thank the woman after the visit and inform the family when you (ASHA) will return. PAGE 284 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 14suggestion is applicable and acceptable, and whether she would be able to implement it. If necessary, ask the woman to repeat what has been suggested. Discuss further and come to an understanding of what can be done Then the third step, you should discuss and try to correct any misconceptions or rumours. Finally, you should also arrange for follow-up visit or referral. Do NOT “prescribe” health advice: You need to “counsel.” See the examples below: Gratuitous Ineffective Messages Useful Health Communication Message To prevent diarrhoea, pay attention to cleanliness. To prevent diarrhoea, please ensure that you wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food or feeding the child and after cleaning up after defecation. Take good care of the child. Are you able to find enough time to feed the child? To play with the child? Who looks after the child when you are at work? Your child is now one year old. You must give it nutritious food. Would it be possible for you to give your child an egg daily (or milk, green vegetables etc)? How would you manage it? Can you afford it? Would other children in the family also demand it, and would that create a problem? Difficult Situations If the woman is shy • Speak of general things to ‘warm her', 'you manage it? Can you afford it? Would other children in the family also demand it, and would that create a problem? Difficult Situations If the woman is shy • Speak of general things to ‘warm her up’. • Encourage the woman to speak. • Praise the woman more to make her confident. • Repeat the questions. If the woman is non-cooperative or argumentative • Praise the women to make her feel secure. • Sympathise with her and be friendly; do not get angry. • Spend more time in listening to her. • Do not push if the woman is still not immediately receptive but just say that you would like to come again. If the woman is curious and asks many questions • Answer her questions in simple language. • Explain that you will be coming every month so they can talk again. PAGE 285 Part A Being an ASHA 157. Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) VHND is a common platform for allowing the people to access the services of the ANM and the male health worker and of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC). It is held at the AWC once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the children, provides antenatal care to pregnant women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. In addition, the ANM provides a basic level of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. The VHND is an occasion for health communication on a number of key health issues. It should be a/g308 ended by the members of the PRI, particularly the women members, pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. The VHND is to be seen as a major mobilisation event to reinforce health messages. You should provide information on the topics given below during the VHND. These topics can be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. Topics for Health Communication during the VHND • Care in pregnancy, including nutrition, importance of antenatal care and danger sign recognition. • Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care. • Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate complementary feeding. • Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking', 'and danger sign recognition. • Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care. • Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate complementary feeding. • Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and discussion on what actions can be taken locally to improve the situation. • Delaying the age at marriage, postponing the ﬁ rst pregnancy and the need for spacing. • Adolescent health awareness, including nutrition, retention in school till high/higher secondary level, anaemia correction, menstrual hygiene and responsible sexual behaviour. • Prevention of Malaria, TB and other communicable diseases. • Awareness on prevention and seeking care for RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS. • Prevention of tobacco use and alcoholism. What should you do for a successful VHND? • Make a list of the following and ensure their presence during the VHND meeting: /rhombus6 Pregnant women for their antenatal or postnatal care.

Maintaining drug kit stocks: You are provided with a drug kit so as to be able to treat minor ailments/problems. The drug kit contains: Paracetomol tablets, Albendazole tablets, Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets, Chloroquine tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), and eye ointment. In addition, the kit may contain condoms and oral contraceptive pills, pregnancy testing kits, and malaria testing kits. The contents of the kit may change depending on the needs of the state. The drug kit is to be re-ﬁ lled on a regular basis from the nearest PHC. To keep a record of consumption of the drugs, and for eﬀ ective re-ﬁ lling and ensuring adequate/timely availability, a drug kit stock card is maintained. This can be completed by the person who reﬁ lls the kit or by you. (Annexe 1: Sample drug kit stock card) PAGE 288 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 189. ASHA Support and Supervision • For ASHA to be eﬀ ective and for her skills to be updated, she needs both on-the-job support and refresher trainings. • Each ASHA will be supported in the ﬁ eld by an ASHA facilitator. • The ASHA facilitator will interact with ASHA at least twice if not thrice a month. • At least one of these interactions will be in the form of a “mentoring” visit to the hamlet where she provides her services. This would focus on mentoring or on-the-job training. • Another one or two interactions would be in a local review meeting. This could be held at Gram Panchayat (GP) level, or at the sector level or even at the block level. • Each of the facilitators will have a clear protocol of activities to follow for the mentoring visit to the ASHAs and for the review meetings. The purpose of these interactions are: a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and information on what work ASHA is doing. b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems they encounter. c For providing', 'these interactions are: a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and information on what work ASHA is doing. b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems they encounter. c For providing training and refresh or update their knowledge and skills. d For helping ASHAs plan their work.e For building up mutual solidarity and motivation.f For troubleshooting problems, especially as regards payments and addressing grievances. g For reﬁ lls to their drug kit • The Medical Oﬃ cer In-charge of the block PHC/CHC should a/g308 end at least one monthly meeting of all ASHAs in the Primary Health Centre (PHC) area, to review work progress. PAGE 289 PART B Maternal Health PAGE 290 PAGE 291 21 Maternal HealthPart BMaternal Health 1. Pregnancy Diagnosis Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as possible a/g286 er the ﬁ rst missed period. There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early: • Missed Periods • Pregnancy testing: through use of the Nischay home pregnancy test card /rhombus6 The Nischay test card can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. /rhombus6 The test can be done immediately a/g286 er the missed period. /rhombus6 A positive test means that the woman is pregnant. /rhombus6 The beneﬁ t of early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be registered early by the ANM and start ge/g308 ing antenatal care soon. /rhombus6 A negative test means that the woman is not pregnant. In case she is not pregnant and does not want to get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt a family planning method. /rhombus6 The result of the test should be kept conﬁ dential. Instructions for the use of the Nishcay Kit are in Annexe 2. PART B 1 All knowledge areas in this chapter have been covered in ASHA Module 2. Objectives of this session By the end of the session the ASHA will learn about: • Diagnosing pregnancy using Nischay Kit. • Determining Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up 1. • Identiﬁ cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral. • Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up', 'of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up 1. • Identiﬁ cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral. • Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up with pregnant women. • Knowledge of safe delivery. • Understand obstetric emergencies and enable appropriate referral for emergencies.• Updating Maternal Health Cards with support from the ANM. PAGE 292 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 22 Determining LMP and EDD When pregnancy is diagnosed, you should help the pregnant woman in calculating the probable date when she is likely to deliver. Steps to ﬁ nd the EDD• Find out from the woman the date of the ﬁ rst day of her LMP .• Then count nine months a/g286 er that date.• Add seven days to that date.For example, If the ﬁ rst day of the LMP is: 10th Dec. 2009 Nine months later is: 10th Sept. 2010 Adding seven days is: 17th Sept. 2010 Therefore, the expected date of delivery is 17th September 2010 Note: This method only gives an approximate date of delivery, and baby may be born anytime during 15 days before or after the EDD.

Four antenatal visits must be ensured, including registration within the first three month period. The suggested schedule is as below: 1st visit: Within 12 weeks—preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected— for registration of pregnancy and first antenatal check-up 2nd visit: Between 14 and 26 weeks 3rd visit: Between 28 and 34 weeks 4th visit: After 36 weeks It is advisable for the pregnant woman to visit the Medical Officer (MO) at', 'and first antenatal check-up 2nd visit: Between 14 and 26 weeks 3rd visit: Between 28 and 34 weeks 4th visit: After 36 weeks It is advisable for the pregnant woman to visit the Medical Officer (MO) at the PHC for the third antenatal visit, as well as availing of the required investigations at the PHC. • Early registration • Regular weight check • Blood test for anaemia • Urine test for protein and sugar • Measure blood pressure • One tablet of IFA every day for three months to prevent anaemia • Treatment for anaemia • Two doses of Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine • Nutrition counselling • Preparing for birth. 2 The components of ANC have already been covered in Module 2. Essential components2 of antenatal care PAGE 294 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 24Where are ANC services provided? The nearest place for ANC services for a woman is at the AWC during the monthly VHND. The pregnant w oman could also go to the Sub-Centre, where the ANM will provide ANC services. ANC services are also provided at the PHC or Community Health Centre (CHC) or district hospital. Identification of problems and danger signs Given below are complications that can occur during the antenatal period for which pregnant w omen must seek treatment in an institution: • Jaundice, high blood pressure, fever with chills, or bleeding • Severe anaemia • Women with protein and sugar in their urine• Swelling of feet, face and hands.Given below are danger signs for which pregnant women must seek delivery in a centre where they can manage complications including those requiring surgery and blood transfusion. • Mothers who had a complication in a previous pregnancy (C section, prolonged labour, stillborn, neonatal death) • Pregnant women with severe anaemia.• Pregnant women having any of the danger signs of the antenatal period which are still persisting at the time of delivery. Some women are to be considered more at risk of developing complications during delivery and therefore, must opt for an institutional delivery. These include: • Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough', 'institutional delivery. These include: • Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough weight. Key tasks to be undertaken during ANC • List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest families, and in any sections which tend to get le/g286 out, e.g. women from SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main village, or in hamlets that fall between villages and newly migrant women. • Educate pregnant women about care in pregnancy, especially on the importance of increased nutrition, rest, and complete ANC services. PAGE 295 25 Maternal HealthPart B• Emphasise the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet during pregnancy. The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of cereals, pulses (including beans and nuts), vegetables including greens, milk, eggs, meat and ﬁ sh. If possible, the family should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. Meat and nuts are especially good for anaemic women. You should explain to the mother and family that no foods should be forbidden during pregnancy. • See when ANC is due for each check-up and remind them appropriately. • Escort pregnant woman to VHND where they are hesitant or need such support. • Ensure that all components of ANC are delivered.• Ensure that the Maternal Card is updated. Planning for a Safe Delivery You should • Know how to calculate the EDD and communicate this to the pregnant woman. • Know which institutions in the area provide different levels of care and establish linkages with providers there. • At least once before delivery, take the pregnant woman to this centre and introduce her to the providers. • Know what transport is available _ whether funded by the state or other private means _ that is easily accessible and affordable and how to call on it when the need arises. • Assist all pregnant women and families to prepare plans for birth: including identifying funding sources should money be required at short notice. Sometimes Self-Help Groups (SHGs) may advance money in emergency even if the woman is not a member. This is', 'and families to prepare plans for birth: including identifying funding sources should money be required at short notice. Sometimes Self-Help Groups (SHGs) may advance money in emergency even if the woman is not a member. This is most important for women in remote hamlets, or in communities which are currently not availing of institutional delivery or those at high risk for complications. • Know what records (BPL card) need to be carried to the institution. • Share birth plans with ANM and PHC MO at the VHND or monthly meeting. • Identify mothers with complications, or a high likelihood of developing complications with support from the ANM. Inform them of the institutions that it is most advisable for them to go to and motivate the mother and the family to go there and escort them if required. PAGE 296 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 262. Birth Preparedness for a Safe Delivery What is Birth Preparedness? This is a method of planning in advance by the pregnant mother and her family for a safe and comfortable deliv ery and for care a/g286 er delivery. You should help every family make this plan in consultation with the ANM. What are the choices available to the mother? 1. If there are any danger signs or complications: Identify the nearest institution (CHC/District Hospital) which has the staﬀ and equipment to provide Comprehensiv e Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC), and counsel the mother and the family to go there. 2. If there are no complications: Counsel the mother to go to the PHC which is open 24 X 7, where there is a team of doctors and nurses or ANMs to conduct the delivery and provide care for the mother and newborn. These institutions can manage some complications and transfer immediately to a higher facility if complications requiring surgery or blood transfusion develop. The list of such institutions can be obtained from the ANM. The place should be clean and safe and friendly and have a skilled nurse or doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a/g286 er delivery. 3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7', 'doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a/g286 er delivery. 3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7 PHC or if it is too far away: Advise the mother could go the Sub-Centre, provided it is accredited as a delivery centre, which means the ANM has been trained as a Skilled Birth A/g308 endant (SBA), and is available, and there are minimum facilities for delivery. 4. If there are no complications or not a high risk case for developing complications and the mother and family insist on delivering at home, despite counselling: You could work with the ANM to enable a delivery by SBA. This should be agreed to only if you are sure that the family can organise transport and funds at very short notice. The SBA should be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the onset of labour at the home/Sub-Centre and should able to stay through the process of labour and for a few hours a/g286 erwards. A team of two or three women with experience in a/g308 ending at labour would be helpful. What does a birth preparedness plan contain? (See Annexe-3 for format for individual plan) When should a birth preparedness plan be readied? It should be ready as early as possible a/g286 er conﬁ rming the pregnancy, and in consultation with the family (husband, mother-in-law, or other decision makers). You should review the plan in the third trimester (a/g286 er seventh month) with the family and the ANM. At this time, the choice of institution and the transport should be ﬁ nalised. PAGE 297 27 Maternal HealthPart BDecisions People Make Where should I go for a safe delivery? Birth Micro Plan of ASHA/ANM/AWW I help every family with a pregnant woman to make a birth plan. If she has any danger signs or complications, I will ask her to go to the CHC or DH when her delivery is due.I must also make arrangements to ensure that the transport is ready and available at that time. But if she and her family do not want to go that far and the 24X7 PHC is crowded, I will advise her', 'make arrangements to ensure that the transport is ready and available at that time. But if she and her family do not want to go that far and the 24X7 PHC is crowded, I will advise her to go to the nearby sub-centre where two ANMs are trained to conduct deliveries and one of them is always there. For some women, family circumstances and beliefs make even going to the sub-centre diffi cult. I will then get the ANM to come to her house, and will assist in the preparations needed, after counselling that a safe delivery in this situation may not always be possible. If I go to the PHC which is open 24 hours, I will be cared for and can rest for two days. Also, if there is any surgery needed, they can rush me to the big hospital quickly. Woman’s choice I will also need to ensure that I have an escort, maybe the ASHA, to accompany me, and that someone is taking care of the children and things at home. If danger signs or complications develop before the delivery, I will need to go to the big hospital straight away, but I hope that does not happen. If she has no complications, I will counsel her to go to the 24X7 PHC, and for this too, I must ensure that transport arrangements are made in time. PAGE 298 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 283. Management of Anaemia In India, anaemia among women is very common. The chances of a mother having a delivery before term, or even dying are higher among mothers with severe anaemia. In order to make sure that all women have good iron stores, all pregnant women should be given iron tablets, even if they are not anaemic. Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test, which measures the amount of a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb). Low levels of Hb mean that the woman has anaemia (see box below). The test should be performed during the antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal 7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia If a woman', 'antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal 7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia If a woman during the time of pregnancy has Hb level below 11g/dl, she is considered to be suﬀ ering from anaemia. Common symptoms of severe anaemia include:• Very pale tongue• Weakness• General swelling in body. For women who do not have anaemia (Hb more than 11 g/dl) The pregnant woman should take one tablet of IFA every day for at least 100 days (prophylactic dose), starting a/g286 er the ﬁ rst trimester, at least 14-16 weeks of gestation to prevent anaemia. This dosage regimen is to be repeated again for three months a/g286 er the delivery. If a woman is found to be anaemic: • The woman should be given two IFA tablets per day for three months. This means that a pregnant w oman with anaemia needs to take at least 200 tablets of IF A. Besides taking IFA tablets, you should encourage the pregnant woman, where possible, to increase her dietary intake of iron-rich food. • The Hb level should be estimated again a/g286 er one month. If the level increases, you should tell the woman to continue with two tablets of IFA daily until the Hb comes to normal. If the Hb does not rise in spite of taking IFA tablets, in the prescribed dose, you should refer the woman to the nearest facility that is equipped to manage complications in pregnancy. • You should refer women with severe anaemia immediately to the nearest PHC/CHC/DH for further treatment. Such women may need injections or blood transfusions. PAGE 299 29 Maternal HealthPart B• The dosage regimen of two IFA tablets per day should be repeated for three months post-partum also. Counselling pregnant women on anaemia: • Encourage women to take iron-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, whole pulses, ragi, jaggery, meat and liver. This advice should be discussed with family and ﬁ nalised based on the family situation. • Encourage the woman, where possible, to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption', 'and ﬁ nalised based on the family situation. • Encourage the woman, where possible, to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption of iron. • Counsel the women on the necessity of taking IFA, the dangers associated with anaemia, and inform the women that these side-eﬀ ects are common and not serious, and will reduce over time. • IFA tablets must be taken regularly, preferably early in the morning on an empty stomach. If the woman has nausea and pain in abdomen, she may take the tablets a/g286 er meals or at night. This will avoid nausea. • Dispel the myths and misconceptions related to IFA and convince the woman about the importance of taking it. An example of a common myth is that the consumption of IFA may aﬀ ect baby’s complexion. • Many women do not take IFA tablets regularly due to some common side-eﬀ ects such as nausea, constipation and black stools. Tell women not to worry about passing black stool while consuming IFA. It is normal. • In case of constipation, the woman should drink more water and add roughage (plenty of green leafy vegetables) to her diet. • IFA tablets should not be consumed with tea, coﬀ ee, milk or calcium tablet as it reduces the absorption of iron. • IFA tablets may make the woman feel less tired than before. However, despite feeling be/g308 er, she should not stop taking the tablets and must complete the course as advised by the healthcare provider. • Ask the woman to return to you if she has problem taking IFA tablets. How do you get the IFA?The IFA tablets are part of your drug kit. Try to ensure that you always have enough stock. Either your facilitator or a person appointed by the MO of the PHC is given the responsibility of reﬁ lls for the drug kit. IFA tablets are also made available at VHND or in any health facility.

Care during Delivery Observation of the delivery process was not part of previous ASHA training modules. In this module, you will be oriented to normal delivery processes and newborn care, and also develop the skills for recording the various events and pregnancy outcome. Even though you are not required to manage delivery, you may have to help if the delivery starts during transport. This knowledge also gives you conﬁ dence to know more about this. You should try and stay with the pregnant woman through delivery in the institution or at home, and post-partum period. You could therefore also be a ‘Birth Companion’ to the mother during the stay at the institution. This is not a compulsion, but a desirable service. Alternatively, a close relative could also be the birth companion. PAGE 305 35 Maternal HealthPart BBefore Delivery The delivery room should be cleaned before the delivery. If the delivery is happening at home, you should facilitate a clean delivery space. Immediately after birth, if the baby remains naked, it may become cold. Hence, baby clothes should be kept ready before delivery. 1st Stage of labour Starts from the beginning of pain until the mouth of the womb is fully open. This happens inside and cannot be seen. The bag of water also breaks at the end of this stage. The fluid is usually clear but may be yellow or green or red. If green, it indicates infection. This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours in the first pregnancy. May take much less time in subsequent pregnancies. Illustration (a) - drawing of side view of a pregnant woman. In illustration (b) - the mouth of the womb is almost closed, and thick.In illustration (c) - the mouth is thinner and is opening little.In (d) - the mouth of the womb is fully open.

Points for you to pay attention to if you are also present at the time of delivery in the institution: • It is not necessary to shave the area, or give an enema to the mother at the time of delivery. • All deliveries do not require an episiotomy (cut at the perineal site). • Fundal pressure (pushing on the abdomen) should not be applied. • You should be alert if injections are being given to hasten the delivery process. Such injections can cause a baby who is still born, birth of a baby who is unable to breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should give the injection.', 'breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should give the injection. • When the mother and baby stay in the hospital and if you are staying with them as a birth companion, she should ensure that the mother and baby are seen by the MO and nurse at least twice a day and whenever required if there are problems. The very top of the head comes ﬁ rst, then the eyes, nose and mouth (d). While in most babies, the eyes are facing the ﬂ oor; sometimes they are born looking towards the ceiling. When the baby’s head is out, it turns to one side (e) and the shoulders and rest of the body are delivered (f). Once out, the baby will cry. Delivery of Placenta The cord will be connected to the placenta which is still inside the womb. PAGE 308 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 386. Post-Partum Care Post-partum care is the period a/g286 er delivery of the placenta up to six weeks a/g286 er birth.3 3 Post-partum care has been covered in ASHA Module 2.Tasks for you to undertake during this period • Conducting home visits to mother and child: Mothers and newborns need care from the time of birth to six weeks a/g286 er the delivery. The recommendation for postnatal care is to visit on the 3rd day a/g286 er delivery, on the 7th day and at the end of six weeks, i.e on the 42nd day. For the newborn, the recommendation is to visit on the 3rd day, 7th day, 14th day, 21st day and 28th day. A/g286 er this period, visits are still needed once in two weeks till the child is two years old for nutrition advice, immunisation advice, and support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, for illness prevention and just to remain in touch. • In eﬀ ect therefore, you would need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day, 21st, and 28th day, and a/g286 er that, once every two weeks starting from the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is', 'need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day, 21st, and 28th day, and a/g286 er that, once every two weeks starting from the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is born at home, then of course you should be there at birth or at least visit her within the ﬁ rst hour. • Advice to the mother during these visits: /rhombus6 Assess the mother for signs of complications (see below for the list of complications) and ensure appropriate referral. /rhombus6 Encourage her to rest for at least six weeks a/g286 er childbirth. Families should be counselled to allow this. /rhombus6 Encourage her to eat more food than usual. She can eat any kind of food but high protein foods – pulses and legumes (nuts are especially useful), foods of animal source. She should also drink plenty of ﬂ uids. Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Schedule of visits and tasks to be performed at each visit.• Understand the possible complications of the post-partum period.• Be able to identify the complications and refer appropriately. PAGE 309 39 Maternal HealthPart B/rhombus6 Encourage and support for exclusive breastfeeding (Please see section on Breastfeeding-Part C, Section 3) /rhombus6 Discuss with the mother the need for contraceptive services. Caution her on the risk of unprotected sex and the high chances of conceiving again. You should counsel her on the importance of spacing the next child birth for her own health and that of the baby. You should help her in making the choice of the method of family planning, whether spacing or limiting. Complications during the post-partum period Some women can develop complications a/g286 er the childbirth. The symptoms of these major complications are: 1. Excessive bleeding: Ask the mother if the bleeding is heavy. O/g286 en this is quite obvious, but sometimes it may be diﬃ cult to judge. If the woman is using more than ﬁ ve pads a day or more than one thick cloth in a day, she is having heavy bleeding. You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications. You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding.', 'thick cloth in a day, she is having heavy bleeding. You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications. You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding. Referral is most urgent. Even the delay of a few minutes can make a diﬀ erence. 2. Puerperal Sepsis (Infections): Ask if the discharge is foul smelling. If the answer is yes, then suspect infection. Fever, chills and pain in abdomen along with the foul smell make infections even more likely. You should measure temperature to conﬁ rm fever. Referral is required since the mother needs antibiotics. Referral on the same day is advisable. 3. Convulsions with or without swelling of face and hands, severe headache, and blurred vision: Such patients need immediate referral. If ANM is available within 15 minutes, she can stabilise the patient before referral. 4. Anaemia: You should check if the mother is pale and enable the mother to get her blood Hb status checked (for management of anaemia in the post-partum period, please see Section 3). 5. Breast engorgement and Infection: (Part C: Newborn Health) PAGE 310 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 406. Perineal Swelling and Infection: If the mother has a small tear at the opening of her vagina (or has had stitches during the delivery), she should keep the area clean. She can apply cloth dipped in hot water, twice a day and hold it to her genitals. This will give her relief and help the healing. If there is fever, she should be referred to the PHC or CHC. A tablet of paracetomol would help both the pain and the fever. 7. Post-Partum Mood Changes: Some women may suﬀ er from mood changes a/g286 er delivery. They need counselling and family support. The changes usually disappear a/g286 er a week or so. If the changes become severe then referral is required.

Care of the Baby at the time of Delivery Many babies die immediately after birth due to asphyxia. In case of home delivery, when mild labour pains start, you can manage asphyxiated babies by removing mucus and can initiate respiration with the help of the instruments you have. You should encourage the mother to start breastfeeding immediately after the delivery, as this will help in quick delivery of placenta and minimises bleeding. Starting to breastfeed immediately after the birth makes the baby stronger. Chances of the baby’s death and getting sick are higher among the babies born before time (pre-term) and in LBW babies, (Weight less than 2500 gm increases the risk and below 1800 gm, the risk is considered very high.) PAGE 314 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 442. Schedule of Home Visits for the care of the Newborn The purpose of these visits is to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, discourage harmful practices such as bo/g308 le feeds, early baths, giving other substances by mouth, and to identify early signs of sepsis or other illnesses in the newborn. • The newborn requires a visit immediately a/g286 er birth (or within the ﬁ rst 24 hours), and on Day 2, if the baby is born at home. • If the baby is born at a facility, persuade and support the mother to stay for at least 48 hours, and therefore, the ﬁ rst two visits are taken care of in the institution. However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the', 'least 48 hours, and therefore, the ﬁ rst two visits are taken care of in the institution. However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the nurse/ANM there. • If the baby is born in a health facility, or at home, you should visit the baby on Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additional visits are needed for newborn babies which are LBW, born before term and are sick. 3. Examining the Newborn at Birth Steps for you to take “just after” the baby is born if the baby is born at home, or if you are present at the delivery, 1. Ask the mother about/observe the ﬂ uid a/g286 er the waters break. 2. If the ﬂ uid is yellow/green, as soon as the head is seen (even before delivery of complete baby), clean the mouth of the baby with gauze piece. 3. As soon as the baby is born, note the time of birth and start counting time. 4. Observation of baby at birth or within the ﬁ rst 30 seconds and at 5 minutes a/g286 er birth for movement of limbs, breathing and crying. The ﬁ gure below will enable the assessment of whether the newborn should be recorded as a live or still birth. All six have to be “No” to declare a still birth. Even if one is “yes” the baby should be declared as live birth. 5. If there is no cry or a weak cry, if there is no breathing or weak breathing or gasping, this condition is called Asphyxia. If the baby is asphyxiated (does not breathe at birth), and there is no doctor or nurse, you should try to help and this skill is taught to you, in Module 7. However, in many such newborns, your eﬀ orts may not make enough diﬀ erence and you should not feel bad or blame yourself for this. (Management of asphyxia will be taught in Module 7).

Measure newborn temperature. First examination of newborn a. You should conduct the first examination within first 24 hours of delivery and look for the following:• Whether the baby has any abnormality such as curved limbs, jaundice, bump on head, cle/g286 lip. • How the baby is suckling at the breast. PAGE 317 Part C Newborn Health 47• Whether the baby has loose limbs. • Listen to the cry of the baby. • Provide care of eyes. If there is pus/purulent discharge from eyes and no doctor or nurse available, apply tetracycline ointment. Even for normal eyes, tetracycline is used as a preventive, so even in doubt as to whether it is pus, it could be given. • Keep umbilical cord dry and clean. b. General precautions the family must take The newborn is delicate and can easily fall sick if the family and mother are not careful. Y ou should explain some general precautions that the family should take. • Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not be bathed until the ﬁ rst seven days, many families', 'not careful. Y ou should explain some general precautions that the family should take. • Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not be bathed until the ﬁ rst seven days, many families would like to bathe the baby on the ﬁ rst or second day. For a normal baby, if the family insists, the baby could be bathed a/g286 er the second day. But in the case of LBW baby, you must insist on their waiting for at least seven days. You should explain that bathing the baby and leaving it wet or exposed may cause it to get cold and fall sick. Thus, it is be/g308 er to wipe the baby with a warm wet cloth and dry the baby immediately. • Keep the baby away from people who are sick. • People who are sick with cold, cough, fever, skin infection, diarrhoea, etc. should not hold the baby or come in close contact with the baby. • The newborn baby should not be taken to places where there are other sick children. • The newborn baby should also not be taken to places where there are large gatherings of people. c.

Umbilical cord care • Cord should be kept clamped, till it dries and falls oﬀ . • No application of any medicine is required if there is no bleeding or discharge. • The umbilical cord should be kept clean and dry at all times. i. Eye care Skill checklist for applying eye ointment If a newborn has pus discharging from its ey es y ou can put antibiotic ointment in the baby’s eyes or a capsule which is available in the market. How to put antibiotic ointment:• Gently pull the baby’s lower eyelid down.• Squeeze a thin line of ointment moving from the inside corner to the outside of the eye. • Do not touch the baby’s eye with the tip of the tube. If the tube touches the babies eyes, it shouldn’t be used again. • If the eyes are swollen with pus, then put the ointment two times a day for 5 days. Remember: The usual bathroom scales cannot reliably record small diﬀ erences in weights. That is why bathroom scales cannot accurately record newborn weight and it is not advisable to use these for weighing newborns. PAGE 320 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 504.

Counselling tips • You are there to help the mother, not to take over. • Use verbal and non-verbal skills to make her feel at ease. • Encourage and praise her; every mother has the ability to breastfeed. O/g286 en mothers are worried that they are inexperienced and lack the conﬁ dence. Many women do not breastfeed successfully because they do not get good advice, support and encouragement. • If she says something that you do not agree with, do not say ‘that is wrong’. Do not make her feel bad or stupid. You can repeat what she says (For example, ‘I hear you saying that you think you don’t have enough milk....’ Ask her why she thinks so. Listen to what she is saying and why). • A/g286 er you assess the breastfeeding, you should check the baby’s weight gain. • Give advice in simple and clear language. • Make sure the mother understands what you are saying.• Have her repeat what she will try to do. g. Why only breastfeeding? Giving other food or ﬂ uid may harm the baby in following ways• It reduces the amount of breast milk taken by the baby.• It may contain germs from water or on feeding bo/g308 les or utensils. These germs can cause diarrhoea. • It may be too dilute, so the baby becomes malnourished.• Baby does not get enough iron from cow’s and goat’s milk and may thus develop anaemia. • Baby may develop allergies.• Baby may have diﬃ culty digesting animal milk; the milk can cause diarrhoea, rashes or other symptoms.

PAGE 323 Part C Newborn Health 53Managing Common Breastfeeding Problems Sore nipples Causes: poor latch-on or positioning at breast Management • Improve attachment and/or position. • Continue breastfeeding (reduce engorgement if present). • Build mother’s confidence. • Advise her to wash breast once a day; not to use soap for this. • Put a little breast milk on nipples after feeding is finished (to lubricate the nipple) and air-dry. • Wear loose clothing. • If nipples are very red, shiny, flaky, itchy, and their condition does not get better with above treatment, it may be fungus infection. Apply gentian violet paint to nipples after each breastfeed for five days. If the condition does not improve, refer to a doctor. Inverted nipples Sometimes the nipple will retract in to the breast, and can be checked even during pregnancy. The best treatment is to encourage the mother to gently pull out the nipple and roll it, several times in a day. Not enough milk Causes: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding; infrequent feeding; giving fluids other than breast milk; mother’s anxiety, exhaustion, insecurity; inadequate family support. Management • Decide whether there is enough milk or not: /rhombus6 Does the baby pass urine six times or more each day? /rhombus6 Has the baby gained sufficient weight? (During the 1st week there is usually a small weight loss, after that a newborn should gain 150- 200 gm per week.) /rhombus6 Is the baby satisfied after feeds? • Re-assure mother. • If there is not enough milk, have the baby feed more often. • Check breastfeed to observe mother attachment and positioning of the mother and baby. • Encourage rest. Emphasise the mother to drink and eat more. • Praise her and return for follow-up.

Management • Prevent by: /rhombus6 Starting breastfeeding soon after delivery and feeding often.. /rhombus6 Ensuring correct attachment. /rhombus6 Encouraging on-demand feeding. • If baby is able to suckle, feed more frequently, help with positioning. • If the baby is not able to attach, apply warm compresses to breast, gently massage from outside toward the nipple and express some milk until the areola is soft, then put baby to the breast, making sure that the attachment is correct. • Have baby feed often to empty out the breasts. If it is not possible, ask the mother to express some milk herself. • If breasts are red and hard, continue to feed often. Use warm compresses and gently massage breasts towards nipple. Take mother’s temperature. If she has fever, mother should visit the doctor. She should continue to breastfeed (from both sides) even if she is taking antibiotics. Expressing milk by hand 1. Wash hands with soap and water. 2. Place a warm compress on the breast for a few minutes if desired.3. Gently massage the breast starting from the chest moving toward the nipple; do this in a circle (near the underarm, and then to the bo/g308 om of the breast etc.), so that all parts of the breast are massaged. 4. Lean forward and support the bo/g308 om of the breast with one hand.5. Hold the areola between thumb and two ﬁ ngers of other hand. Put her hand on the areola above the nipple and the two ﬁ ngers on the areola below the nipple. 6. Press toward the chest (about 1-2 cm) and then squeeze the milk reservoirs beneath the areola (do not squeeze the nipple). 7. Press and release the thumb and ﬁ rst ﬁ nger several times until the milk drips out. Use a clean bo/g308 le or a cup to collect the milk. Milk may drip at the beginning and then spray out a/g286 er it starts ﬂ owing. 8. Rotate the thumbs and ﬁ nger around the areola so that the milk is removed from all the reservoirs. 9.

Babies have diﬃ culty maintaining their temperature at birth and in the ﬁ rst day of life.They come out wet, and lose heat quickly. If they get cold, they use up energy, and can become sick. LBW and pre-term babies are at greater risk of ge/g308 ing cold. When and why do most newborns get cold?Most newborns lose heat in ﬁ rst minute a/g286 er delivery. They are born wet. If they are le/g286 wet and naked, they lose a lot of heat to the air. A newborn baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn', 'baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn baby is not properly dried, wrapped, and its head is not kept covered, it can lose 2 to 4 degree Celsius within 10-20 minutes. Example: If the baby’s temperature was 97.7 degree Fahrenheit (36.5 degree Celsius) (normal temperature) at the time of birth and if there was a loss of 2.7 degree Fahrenheit because the baby was not properly dried and covered, the body temperature will become 95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), which is below normal. What is the term for a situation when a baby’s temperature falls below normal?When a baby has a temperature below normal, it suﬀ ers from hypothermia. What happens to a baby with hypothermia?A baby who is cold, and has a low temperature (hypothermia) suﬀ ers from: • Decreased ability to suckle at the breast, leading to poor feeding and weakness.5. Keeping the Newborn Warm Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Identify the newborn whose body temperature is less than normal and whose body temperature is more than normal. • Teach mothers how to keep the newborns warm. • Teach mothers how to re-warm cold babies.• Teach mothers how to control newborn temperature in hot weather. • Learn to take the temperature. PAGE 328 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 58• Increased susceptibility to infections. • Increased risk of death, especially in LBW and pre-term babies. How can you tell if a baby is hypothermic? • The early sign is cold feet. • Then, the body becomes cold. • The best method is to measure the baby’s body temperature. (This skill has already been taught to you) How to keep newborns warm • Before delivery, warm up the room (warm enough for adults).• Immediately a/g286 er delivery, dry the baby. • Put a cap on the baby since a lot of heat could be lost though its head.• Place in skin-to-skin contact with mother.• Cover or put clothes on the baby, wrap it up with clean cloth, and place it', 'cap on the baby since a lot of heat could be lost though its head.• Place in skin-to-skin contact with mother.• Cover or put clothes on the baby, wrap it up with clean cloth, and place it close to its mother. • Initiate early breastfeeding.• Bathing for newborns: /rhombus6 It is best to wait until the second day to bathe the baby. One should wait seven days in case of LBW baby. /rhombus6 If the family insists on bathing the ﬁ rst day, please ask them to delay for at least six hours to give the baby time to adjust with its new environment. /rhombus6 For small and pre-term babies, do not give a bath until the baby gains weight (this could be few weeks) and weight of baby become 2,000 gm. • To keep a small baby clean, you can give a light oil massage but making sure that the room is warm and the baby is not le/g286 uncovered for more than 10 minutes. DO NOT pour oil into any oriﬁ ce, like the nose or ears at any time. • Keep baby loosely clothed and wrapped. • If it is very warm outside, make sure the baby is not too heavily clothed and wrapped; the baby can also get too hot. • Wherever possible, insist on referral to a facility that is managing sick newborns. If this is not immediately possible, begin the following steps:Warming PAGE 329 Part C Newborn Health 59How to re-warm a baby getting cold? <97 degree Fahrenheit (36.1 degree Celsius) or too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius) • Increase the room temperature. • Remove any wet or cold blankets and clothes. • Hold the baby with its skin next to its mother’s skin (skin-to-skin contact) and place a warmed cloth (not too hot to avoid burns) on its back or chest. As this cloth cools down, replace it with another warmed one, and repeat until the baby is warmer. Continue until the baby’s temperature reaches the normal range. • Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother. • Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the', 'Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother. • Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the blood glucose level. /rhombus6 A common problem in hypothermic babies. If a baby is too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), follow the above advice, and • Place skin-to-skin, and once the baby is a little warmer, then clothe baby and place in a bed pre- warmed with warm clothes, or a hot stone or hot water bottle. (Remove these articles before putting baby on the bed.) • In an institutional delivery, there should be a newborn corner available with a radiant warmer, or some other suitable heating arrangement where the newborn baby can be kept. PAGE 330 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 606. Management of fever in newborn A baby has fever if the temperature is above 99 degree Fahrenheit (37.2 degree Celsius). In the case of high body temperature of the baby during summer, verify in the following manner whether this is due to the body being overdressed or does it really have fever: • Unwrap the baby and take oﬀ its cap.• Ventilate the room too to cool the baby. • Ask the mother to start breastfeeding. • If there is a source of extra heat (like a ﬁ re) in the room, put it out.• Wait for 30 minutes and take the temperature once again. If the baby’s temperature returns to normal, explain to the mother that in very warm weather, the baby does not have to kept covered with additional cloth or kept wrapped. If the temperature is still above normal a/g286 er the above measures have been taken, refer the baby for treatment.

You should encourage parents and other family members to spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the child. Such children eat and absorb food better. 5Accesstohealthservices ◆Accesstohealthservicesmakesforprompttreatmentofillness.Ontheveryﬁrstdayoftheillness,ifyouhelpthemotherdecideonwhetheritisaminorillnessforwhichhomeremedywouldbeadequate,ortobereﬀreredtoadoctor,suchadecisionwouldsavelives.Earlytreatmentwouldpreventmalnutrition. ◆Accesstocontraceptiveservicesisimportant.Iftheageofmotherislessthan19,orthegapbetweentwochildrenislessthanthreeyears,thereisamuchhigherchanceofthechildrenbeingmalnourished. 6Accesstoanganwadiservices ◆Theanganwadiprovidesafoodsupplementforthechilduptotheageof5.Thiscouldbeacookedmeal,orintheformoftake–homerations.Malnourishedchildrenaretobegivenadditionalfoodsupplements.Forchildrenbelowtheageoftwo,take–homerations P a r t A Child Health & Nutrition 9aretobegiven.Evenpregnantwomenandlactatingmothersuptosixmonthsareentitledtogetfoodsupplementsintheanganwadicentres. ◆Weighingthebabyandinformingthefamilyofthelevelofmalnutritionisanotherimportantanganwadiservice. ◆TheanganwadiisalsothesitewheretheVillageHealthandNutritionDay(VHND)isconducted.TheANMvisitseverymonthandthechildisgivenimmunisation,VitaminA,paediatricirontablets,OralRehydrationSalts(ORS)packetsordrugsneededforillnessmanagement. Note Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.

She is being breastfed and only this month was started on complementary food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations from there. Her immunisation is on schedule. Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has no odema, but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite. He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. His immunisation schedule is complete.

They depend on land and farming. Some of them also work as wage labourers innearby towns. In many villages, rearing cattle is a source of income. Most farmersdepend upon rains. Many work as artisans. They work hard to live their life. Some people are too poor. They are grouped as below poverty line (BPL) as per Government criteria. Often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and othermarginalized groups. Families belonging to BPL are eligible for special benefitsunder government schemes. A village may have different settlements fordifferent castes. Everyone needs health care. Yet some groups of people are vulnerable to sickness. The poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people needhealth care more often. Their health needs are not adequately met. They havelittle or no money. At times they have to take loans at very high interest rates to 3 PAGE 14 get admission in hospitals or to buy medicines for their kids. Your role is to guide them to get good care in time and that is affordable. Village people have a practical sense of solving problems with simple resources. Thus they should be involved in village health planning to assesshealth needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address thecommon problems. Schools, fair price shops, water, electricity, seeds, fertilizers, credit, animal care, bus/jeep, roads, employment, forest produce, common grazing grounds, post-office, haat—we need all these services in the village. Health care is just onemore. It is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village. As ASHA, youshall do your best to help your own people in their struggle for health and sharejoys of life.

You should work proactively with anganwadi behenand nurse Didi to decide on the venue and timings for the planning meeting. Village health plans provide a framework for health related actions. Many actions lead to health. Village planning is a community approach to solveproblems.

Proper information and advice help people to avoid diseases andstay healthy. Health information is a lasting asset.

Hospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. But first we need to take care of our body. You can preventdiseases, promote health and prolong life. We say Aarogyam dhansampada. This means health is real wealth. Health makes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. Ill health keeps us away from work and livelihood. Ill health means spending on doctors andmedicines. In villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle topay for hospital expenses. The money people spend on tobacco and liquoralso causes ill health.

Generally a child triples its birth weight at the age of one year. Adult maintains body weight. Weightreduces in old age. Underweight is because of under-eating. Majority of village women and young girls have low weight. Poor diet leads to poor growth in children. Severalchildren in our society are malnourished.

For a house we need stones, bricks, mud and cement, wood, tins or roof, tiles, pipesand wires etc. From these we build foundation, pillars, walls,rooms, windows, doors, floors, water supply, lighting, kitchenchulha, drainage etc. All these parts have different purposes.Similarly in the body we have many parts or organs fordifferent functions. Together they make the human body. Different organs doing different work are linked together as organ systems. Various systems do various tasksnecessary for life. So we have systems for breathing, bloodcirculation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. And all the bodysystems work in cooperation. The body has control systems for this, viz brain,nerves and hormones. Bones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement possible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of differentshapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints makemovement possible. Hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. Andjoints are so different.Body Mapping and Overview of OrgansBody Mapping andOverview of Organs 9 In this lesson we will learn about Different organs of our body, mapping organs on the bodyand about which organdoes what. PAGE 40 You may have seen the guts of sheep or chicken. Human gut is about 22 ft long- more than a room length. Gut is part of the digestive system and digests/absorbs food. While passing through, food will be mixed with secretions from different glands. It also throws off the waste. Whatever body cannot put to use in sent in large intestine and later leaves body through anal opening. Digestion gives us energy to work and nutrients to build and repair the body. Respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let out. Oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy. We have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body. This goes in rounds thanks to our heart pumping each second.

The heart keepsyour blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs andnutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body.Younger you are faster is your heart beat. The blood carries nutrients andoxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks andwagons in the body, through the vessels. Urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat.Reproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction and continuation of life on earth. We know the world through our five windows. We call them sense organs. The eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure,vibration and pain. Thanks to the Nervous system, we respond to these signals. Human brain is most complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or changealertness. This is necessary for our survival. The Nervous system controls severalbody functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.34 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 41 MMaappppiinngg aanndd lleeaarrnniinngg mmoorree aabboouutt oouurr bbooddyy Some of our organs are seen from outside like eyes, ears, breasts, testes. Let us see where the other organs are – Bony skeleton and attached muscles give body its basic frame. Skin covers all the body and protects it from outside environment. Soft organs are inside thechest and abdomen. Brain is inside the skull. A butterfly like important gland (Thyroid) is present in front of the neck. Goitre is actually a swelling of this. Iodized salt prevents it. When we take a deep breath the chest expands. The lungs inside the chest and fill like balloons. The wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs.It indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk. Fear or excitement speeds up the heart.

Fear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times in a minute. We can feel the beats pounding in the chest. Put an ear to yourfriend’s chest. Can you hear heart beats? Where is it? Heart is just left of themiddle of the chest. Pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of thebody. These carry blood from heart to all parts. Can you see the veins under yourskin? Blood is brought back to heart through veins. Let us drink a glass of cold water. Do you feel it going down from throat to stomach? Food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upperabdomen. Stomach stores and digests food for 1-2 hours. Then the food passesdown the gut. Do you feel the rumbling in abdomen when you are hungry? A long coil of gut is in the middle of abdomen. This does further digestion. The long coils lead toa wider short pipe called colon. The well known appendix sits on the colon onlower right corner. Appendix does not serve any special purpose in the body. Colon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen walls– going up from lower right side, and then becomes horizontal going left. Then it goes down to the bagstoring waste. Finally it reaches the anus. Liver is high up on the right side. A swollen liver can be felt below the lower right ribs. Similarly on the left side we have a small spleen. In some diseasessuch as Malaria, spleen becomes very big. We can feel it below the left side ribs.35 BODY MAPPING AND OVERVIEW OF ORGANS PAGE 42 Two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of abdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes. One feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time.

In women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus –the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in thelower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones. The womb grows inpregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the wombon the abdomen. Two egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. The tubes have free finger like ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovariesflank the uterus. Outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women.In men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the end of a long muscular penis. In women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. Inner vulva is soft tags of flesh. These are aptly called inner lips of vulva. The inner lips are connectedabove at clitoris. Clitoris is small external bud like organ. A fleshy cushion ofvulva–called outer lips–protect all these parts. The vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. Hymen, a thin sheet with holes covers the vaginal opening. This may be torn after puberty. Afterpuberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. Breasts also grow in women atthe age of maturity. At maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.36 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA PAGE 43 Many young boys and girls are unawares of these differences.

Diseases amongst women and young girls are not taken up seriously. Women work both at home and outside. Women have to spend considerable time and effort for child care. Fetching water and firewood take many hours of hard work by women. Tedious work in farm can lead to health problems. Women work hard but get lower wages. Women get less food at home. In fact they eat at the end when every one in the family has eaten. Most women are anemic andweak. Their weights are too low to be healthy. Women are given less opportunity for education.Women have less say in decisions in the family.Women and Health 10 In this lesson we will learn about Why women suffer more ill health and neglect Attitudes of society on women’s health PAGE 45 Many men women treat women badly, and even beat them. Women are also sexuallyassaulted. Such women suffer frominjuries and other health problems. Women’s health problems are often ignored or treated late. They have toget permission of the in-laws orhusband’s even for health check up. Theyoften have no money to pay for healthcare on their own. Our health services arealso not fully sensitive to women’s healthcare needs. Infertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. But usually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis-treated. If a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. In reality it all depends on the man’s sperm.

Women bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. They also bear burden of preventing pregnancies. Most contraceptive methods are for women and veryfew for men. Women’s reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually transmitted infections. Vagina provides a larger surface,delicate skin, longer time to hold fluids, moistness tomake germs stay alive for longer. So they get moreinfections than men. Even illnesses affect women differently. Malaria fever can cause abortions, affect growth of baby in the womb. On top of all, women are married young. They suffer its damage in several ways-socially, economically, andto health.39 WOMEN AND HEALTH PAGE 46 Alcoholic husbands exploit women in several ways. They treat their family member harshly everyday to show off the manhood. It makes women’s already difficult lives all the more miserable. There are fewer amenities for toilets for women. In the village, they have to go to answer nature’s call either early morning or evening. Villages may have no air pollution, but that is not true for women. They work in kitchen smoke for 4-5 hrs everyday. It gives them coughs and headaches. And do you know, still they are hardy enough to live longer than men.

You have to match the group, topic and methodof communication. Mismatch of these three will not produce anyimpact. For instance for bringing behavioral change aboutsanitary latrine, we need to talk to women (and men). We can plan and do it as follows: Get a group of 5-10 women/men (not more) in somebody’s house. It is good to select a venue which is accessible to all especially women from scheduled castes/ tribes are comfortable. It is useful to select a house, which already have a sanitary latrine. You need to communicate to people in advance about the venue and timing of this meeting. You can also talk with members of self help group in the village. 11 In this lesson we will learn about How to organize a group meeting PAGE 48 We can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. Just provide the beginning or let someone begin. Gradually other members of group will also start participating in the discussion and share their problems.

It gives baby nutrition and immunity against illnesses. It shrinks the mother’swomb and reduce bleeding. Milk flow is better with frequent suckling. Breast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. No other feeds including water are necessary. Consult a Nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeedingproblem even after your help. Mother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. On delivery the breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. The baby should befed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ-attacks. This should not be thrown away. Breast milk provides for all the needs of the baby. It also contains sufficient water for the baby’s needs. No need for feeding water separately. More the baby suckles, the more milk is produced.Breast FeedingBreast Feeding 23 In this lesson we will learn'}, {'id': 52, 'text': 'needs of the baby.

They are also given at thesub centers and the PHC. Vaccines need cold storage during transportation to retain their power. Child gets fever after DPT injections. This can be treated with ‘Paracetomol’ tablet or liquid. 25 In this lesson we will learn about Vaccines for six dangerous illnesses of childhood. Importance of Vit A dosesTo convince parents to take their children forimmunization. PAGE 88 BCG is usually injected on the baby’s left shoulder. A scar is formed six weeks after injection. It shows that the child may have become immune to Lung TB. Give also five doses of vitamin A. Start from nine months age, and give every six months. This protects children from night blindness. Vit A also boosts child’s immunity against germs. We all know that many parents deny their children immunization. Immunization boosts body’s fighting power against diseases caused by germs. You can help them by explaining benefits of immunization.

At the time of fertilization, the X male chromosome of female egg meets either a girl sperm (XX) resulting in a baby girl or a boy sperm (XY) resulting in baby boy.

Hence it is wrong to blame a woman for not giving birth to a baby boy, as is generally done. Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: As ASHA, you may come across some couples in your village who have no children, or the woman is unable to get pregnant after one or two abortions. If the woman is 20 years of age or above and has been living with her husband for two years, leading a normal marital life but has not become pregnant, advise the couple to consult a nurse or directly go for a check-up to a doctor. Both partners must go together for infertility treatment as either or both of them may be having some problem, which needs treatment. Please note that couples often live apart because one of them has migrated in search of a job. It may be difficult for such couples to have a baby. It is also possible that women are being blamed for having only girls. Some women may be deserted by their husbands and families for not producing a son. You should clearly communicate the role of men and women in deciding the sex of a baby.

However, during pregnancy and childbirth some problems may arise which can threaten the life of the mother, baby or both. It is possible to identify women with some problems quite early if they have routine ante-natal check-up. This will enable them to access specialist care. Care during pregnancy is important to monitor progress and growth of the baby, detect complications at the earliest and treat them accordingly. During the visit the woman and her family should be advised proper nutrition, rest, exercise. They can make plans about where to deliver. This will help both the woman and baby to have a happy and healthy outcome. Minor ailments of pregnancy (e.g. vomiting, heart burn, constipation, backache etc.) are looked after during ANC.

PAGE 124 Unsafe Abortions & Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) 6 You know that sometimes unwanted pregnancies occur. In such cases, the family or woman may want to abort the pregnancy. For this termination, pregnant women often go to untrained persons, dais etc. The methods employed by them for termination are not safe and the facilities are unhygienic. Hence, there is a great risk to the life of these women. You can educate such women with unwanted pregnancies about the dangers of these illegal, unsafe abortions. Such women should be able to confirm whether they are pregnant and if so, they can seek safe and legal abortion at a government health centre or government approved private hospital. Abortions have been legalized since 1971 under certain conditions, as given in under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (“MTP” Act). Such abortions can be carried out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy. Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks (2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to go a'}, {'id': 75, 'text': 'out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of pregnancy.

PAGE 125 24 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA As per PNDT Act, 1. Detection of sex of foetus during pregnancy is illegal. 2. Termination of pregnancy after identifying the sex of the foetus as female is also illegal. There are two methods of terminating the pregnancy: Surgical abortion This is carried out by evacuating the embryo either using a hand held syringe or electric suction machine Medical abortion This is carried out by using pills In both cases, it has to be done by a qualified doctor in any approved centre. Women undergoing MTP can get more details from PHC. There are advantages/disadvantages of both methods. In both cases, there has to be post-abortal care for the women undergoing MTP. Post-abortal care \\uf06e Follow up after abortion is a must especially after the tablets are given for medical abortion. \\uf06e If the woman has any of the following symptoms, she should be immediately referred to the nearest functional FRU/District hospital. \\uf06c Severe bleeding or foul smelling discharge from uterus \\uf06c Severe pain in abdomen \\uf06c Fever \\uf06c Swelling in the abdomen or severe vomiting Counselling of the women will help them to seek safe abortions which will help in decreasing deaths among pregnant women. After an induced abortion, a woman can become pregnant again within six weeks. Hence, it is advisable for the woman (and her partner) to be counselled for appropriate contraception and help them to get the suitable contraceptive if they wish to adopt.It is important to remember: \\uf06e Termination of pregnancy below 20 weeks is legal under provision of MTP Act.

Some mild fevers subside without any treatment/treatment at home e.g. fever with no cough/running nose/ear discharge/with no rash/without diarrhoea/without any obvious infection etc. However, in many children it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness. For fever in children a blood smear examination should be done. Temperature and fever Our body is warm both in summer and winter. When it is very hot outside, our body perspires. It releases water and cools like an earthen pot. When it is very cold outside our body shivers to generate heat. In all seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all its functions.

In all seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all its functions. The normal body temperature is just above 36 0C or 980F. After an attack by germs, our body works very fast. It generates more heat and hence fever. But excess fever may be harmful and lead to several complications. PAGE 141 40 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Measuring fever in adults It is wise to take a sick person’s temperature even if she/he does not mention about having fever. Touch your own forehead and the person’s forehead with both sides of your hand. If the person’s forehead is warmer than yours, she/he may have fever. This is a simple way to find out if someone has fever or not. Thermometer is used for measuring temperature \\uf06e Take a simple oral thermometer and shake it well. See that its mercury mark is below normal (36°C or 98.4°F). Do not hold or touch the bulb of the thermometer. Hold the thermometer by the bigger end with no mercury because mercury line will go up and you might get a wrong reading. \\uf06e Put the thermometer’s bulb end under the tongue in the patient’s mouth or armpit for two minutes. \\uf06e The oral temperature is a bit higher than the armpit. \\uf06e Take it out to see closely while turning it slowly. \\uf06e Record the temperature of a sick person. Is it more than 36°C/98.4°F? \\uf06e Temperature of 37°C–39°C is mild fever. \\uf06e Between 39°C and 40°C is moderate fever. \\uf06e Above 40°C it is high fever (refer any person with high fever after sponging and tablet Paracetamol). \\uf06e Clean it with water after each use. \\uf06e For your information, thermometers have mercury inside which is toxic and hence adequate care should be taken when used for children. Treating Fever General treatment \\uf06e Mild fever generally needs no treatment unless we are thinking of some infections like malaria, TB, pneumonia etc. \\uf06e For moderate fever Paracetamol tablet is the best treatment.

It is not a disease in itself. Paracetamol tablet or syrup is general remedy for fever. It only brings down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not kill the causative germs. For common colds and coughs, Paracetamol or herbal remedies are good enough and no other treatment is necessary. Some home remedies for fever Home remedies soothe the effects of fever. Give her: Gulvel kadha Take a thumb thick piece of Gulvel. Add two-teaspoonful powder of dry ginger. Add 10-12 glasses of water. Boil on slow fire. When three glass full decoction remains, cool it. Give half a glass of freshly made decoction. China grass tea Tea prepared with China grass is a refreshing decoction for someone suffering from simple fever. Specific treatment for illness For illnesses due to various germs we need to give specific medicines. Malaria, pneumonia, TB, etc need specific medicines other than Paracetamol. However viral illnesses have no specific remedies. Virus is a very small germ causing many fever-illnesses. Common cold, flu, dengue, jaundice etc are viral illnesses. Remember several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g., malaria, pneumonia, pus (anywhere) typhoid, TB, kala azar, filariasis, brain fever, HIV/AIDS etc. We will learn about them.

In Book no. 2 you have learnt in general about your roles, simple measures to promote health and prevent diseases among women and children in your village. Yo u have learnt in somewhat greater detail about maternal and child health care including newborn care and nutrition. In this book you will learn in detail about how to prevent unwanted pregnancy, the various methods that are available, the merits of each method, the side effects that need to be watched for and advice that needs to be given. You would also be learning about what advice to give to women and men who have complaints suggestive of reproductive tract infections or sexually transmitted infections. This book will also build on your information on the causes, transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS. You know very well that there are many adolescents and young boys and girls in your village. In general, they may appear to be healthy, but they need advice and counselling for developing healthy habits. They may also need health care for some of the common problems. Also in some parts of our country, marriage takes place at an early age, so that pregnancy and child-bearing happens early in their life. Hence adolescent girls need to get proper care in pregnancy and childbirth. Adolescents need to be 1 PAGE 152 8 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA told about the ill effects of early marriage and pregnancy.

Many couples want to either limit the number of children in the family or wish to wait for some time before having children. Similarly newly married couples may like to delay having children for two to three years. There are several ways by which couples can plan their family’s size Benefits of family planning Using any family planning method for preventing pregnancies can lead to following benefits for the health of mother and children in the family. Mother \\uf06e Women with four or more children have greater risk of death during childbirth. \\uf06e Similarly older women have more problems during childbirth. \\uf06e If adolescent girls get married early i.e. before 18 years they start having children too soon. These girls are more likely to have complications or can die during childbirth. Also children born to these mothers have low birth weight and more likely to die in the first year.2 PAGE 154 10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Children \\uf06e If a woman has children too close i.e. less than 36 months interval, her own health and her children’s health suffer. \\uf06e Family with fewer children will be able to take better care of them, including their educational attainments, growth and development. Other benefits \\uf06e Some contraceptives i.e. condoms (both male and female condom) help in protecting against infections of genital tract including HIV/AIDS as well as preventing unwanted pregnancies. \\uf06e Some methods are good to regulate irregular bleeding from uterus. \\uf06e Use of family planning methods will allow women to exercise their right over their own bodies.

Different family planning methods Pregnancies are caused by the union of egg produced by the woman and the sperm by the man. The egg (which later grows into a baby after union with the sperm) is produced inside the womb of the woman. When a sexual union between man and woman takes place, sperms released to the vagina of woman swim toward the egg in the womb. Union of egg and one of the sperms results in pregnancy. The walls of the womb provide nourishment to the egg. The egg unites with the sperm and grows into a baby. There are five main types of family planning methods: Barrier methods If the sperm does not reach the egg, pregnancy can be avoided. For e xample, when a man uses a condom, the sperm remains inside the condom only. Therefore, the sperms are not able to reach the egg inside the womb. Thus pregnancy is prevented. ManSperm EggWomanSperm enters the egg and unites with itFetus, which grows into a babyHormonal methods This prevents the woman’s o vary from releasing an egg, make it harder for the sperm to reach the egg, and keep the lining of the womb from supporting a pregnancy. For example Mala N tablets. PAGE 155 11 PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES IUDs These are devices inserted inside the womb. They prevent the egg and s perms from fusing and also prevent implantation. Natural methods These help a woman to know when she is fertile, so that she can avoid h aving sex at that time. Permanent methods These are operations, which prevent a man or a woman to have any more children in future. Barrier methods You will be provided with condoms for distribution to women who need them. Women are shy to buy them from the market. Many do not know how to use them and where to keep them.

Also explain that condoms prevent sexually transmitted infections. \\uf06e Make condoms available to all those who wish to use them. \\uf06e If the situation is suitable, you can show the couple how condom is used. Use a flip chart and a condom piece. Sometimes you will have to show it to the woman and ask her to share it with her husband. \\uf06e Some myths and doubts about condoms need to be answered. The misconceptions are: \\uf06c Condoms reduce pleasure of sex. \\uf06c A condom user is an “easy” person. \\uf06e If not properly used, condoms can burst during use. In that case, advise to use emergency contraceptive pills. \\uf06e The female condom is now available in cities, so that even women can use a condom. That is helpful when men are unwilling to put on condoms and it empowers women in risky sex situations.\\uf06e Dispose off the condom properly. \\uf06e Keep condoms in cool, dry place and away from sunlight. \\uf06e Keep a stock of condoms and show how to use them, and make condoms available. Hormonal methods Oral contraceptive pills Oral contraceptives come in cycle packs of 28 pills. Only the first 21 of them contain hormones. The other seven pills contain iron supplements. One pill has to be taken each day. The iron supplement pills are taken after completing 21 hormone pills. Since most women are anaemic, the iron tablets are also helpful. These pills do not interrupt the sexual activity. Above all, unlike condom, OCP is a woman-controlled contraceptive method. There are several brands available PAGE 157 13 in the market.

How to use OC Start the pill from any of first seven days of start of menstrual bleeding and continue until the pack finishes. Start a new pack again. Taken regularly, the pill is almost 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. These pills do not cause abortion. If a woman forgets a day’s dose she should take both the missed and regular tablets together. But one must not miss it for more than two days. If missed for two days, advise her to take pills as soon as she remembers. She can continue taking the pill each day until the pack is finished and also use a condom for sex until seven hormonal pills are taken in a row. You should always mention about the common side effects of oral contraceptives such as nausea, mild headache, tenderness of breasts, spotting between periods and sometimes-irregular periods. Explain that these side effects are not signs of any serious disease. These usually become less or stop in three months. You should help women in getting examined by ANM/Medical Officer, before starting oral pills. You should give monthly supplies to women who have started oral pills after consultation with ANM/Medical Officer. Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP) Emergency contraceptive pills are pills to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. These pills are taken only in some emergency situations. These pills are especially useful for those women who have been subjected to unprotected sex, slippage or bursting of condoms during sex or sexual violence. These pills are to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sexual exposure preferably within 72 hours. These pills will also not work if the woman is already pregnant. She should take two tablets within an interval of 12 hours. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES Take the first tablet as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Take the second tablet 12 hours after you take the first tablet.

These pills are now available at health centres and also at pharmacy shops. No prescription is needed to buy them. They are available as EC pills in the programme. Several commercial and social marketing brands are also available. ECPs, taken as per instructions, provide protection against unwanted pregnancy. Discourage repeated use of ECP and advise for choosing a contraceptive method. ECPs do not protect against infections like STI and HIV/AIDS. Copper-T This is a small T-shaped intra-uterine device (IUD). It is made of pliable plastic with fine copper wire wound around its stem. Two plastic threads hang by its stem. After insertion into the womb, Copper-T stays in place and is effective for a maximum of ten years. Some Copper-T devices available in the market are effective for shorter duration also. How does the Copper-T work? Copper-T works mainly by preventing sperms and egg from meeting. IUD makes it hard for sperm to move through the woman’s reproductive tract and reduces ability of the sperm to fertilize the egg. Possibly it also prevents implantation.

Women should learn how to check the presence of Copper-T. Sometimes its gets expelled out of the womb. It is easy to learn technique of feeling the nylon threads in vagina. Copper-T cannot escape the womb and go up. It can be easily removed by a nurse with a gentle pull. Some women have pain and bleeding after inserting Copper-T. It stops after few cycles. If the condition does not improve then Copper-T can be removed. There are no after-effects if Copper-T is inserted after six weeks of delivery. Removal Copper-T should be removed after 10 years or earlier if woman wishes to have a child, or when she develops heavy bleeding, lower abdominal pain, or severe backache. You should help women in getting Copper-T removed at an appropriate facility. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES PAGE 160 16 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Natural methods There are also natural ways of preventing pregnancies. However, the woman has to learn many things that happen to her body during the menstrual cycle to adopt this method. Awareness of fertility means that a woman learns how to tell when the fertile period of her menstrual cycle starts and ends. Generally menstrual cycle of a woman lasts for 28 days.

You should know more about standard days method from your ANM. Cervical mucus method The opening of the womb of the woman has a sticky fluid called cervical mucus. Typically the mucus is thin and sticky for two days before and after ovulation, which allows for easy passage of the sperm. This is the fertile period. In other days the mucus is thick, dry and breaks on stretching. These days are infertile. These natural methods need a lot of self-control and have a very high failure rate. Therefore it is advisable to adopt other contraceptive methods that have low failure rate in case the woman does not desire pregnancy. However, fertility awareness of a woman is desirable in case of couples with the problem of infertility to increase their chances of conception in many cases. Your responsibilities: \\uf06e Talk about fertility awareness in the meetings of women’s groups. \\uf06e With ovulation awareness a woman can choose to conceive or avoid conception in that cycle.

No hospital stay is necessary. There are two methods for vasectomy \\uf06e Conventional vasectomy \\uf06e No scalpel vasectomy Conventional vasectomy The procedure takes a few minutes and the person can go home in an hour. An experienced doctor uses a scalpel to make a small slit in the scrotum, and finds the vas on each side. The vas is tied and cut to stop the sperms from reaching the semen sac. One stitch is required. No scalpel vasectomy The no-scalpel method uses only a needle puncture to complete the p rocess. No stitch is required.

No scalpel vasectomy The no-scalpel method uses only a needle puncture to complete the p rocess. No stitch is required. So no need to come back for stitch removal. This method is becoming popular. Now doctors are being trained in this new technique. There are less side effects of NSV as compared to conventional vasectomy. This is a safe and easy method and requires only 10-15 minutes. Men commonly think that vasectomy causes weakness — in work and sexual life. This is not true and there is no evidence about it so far. The testicles are not even touched in vasectomy. It is the testicles that secrete hormones and regulate sexual functions. Vasectomy does not affect this any way. There is a need to popularize vasectomy. Why sometimes pregnancy occurs after vasectomy? After vasectomy three months are needed to make the semen sperm-free. A condom has to be used during this period This point is often ignored by men and conception can take place. Condom use for three months after vasectomy can prevent chances of pregnancy. PREVENTING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES PAGE 164 20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Tubectomy (female sterilization) Tying and cutting the tubes that carry eggs (egg-tubes) is tubectomy. There are several ways of doing this procedure. In many states this operation is done using laparoscope (doorbeen). It blocks the meeting of ovum and sperms. This is a popular sterilization method in India. Two methods of tubectomy Mini-laparotomy is the conventional method This involves opening the abdomen through a small incision and operating by hand. Local anaesthesia is given by injection. The mini-lap method needs hospitalization for two days. It is useful for post-childbirth tubectomy, when the womb is still high in the abdomen and easy to reach. Laparoscopy This involves inserting a laparoscope into the abdomen and applying tight plastic rings on the tubes. Laparoscopy can only be performed when the womb returns to its normal size and position (at least six weeks after childbirth). Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail. Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later if'}, {'id': 97, 'text': 'childbirth). Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail. Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later if a tube happens to reopen. In cases of major complications attributable to sterilization, failure and unlikely event of death, you should help in accessing compensation available as per FP insurance scheme. You will get more information from your ANM. Reversing sterilization (recanalization) For all practical purposes, sterilization operations are permanent procedures. But, in unusual circumstances like death of all children, recanalization to join the cut ends of tubes together can be adopted by the couple. But in both men and women, only one in four such procedures succeed. These facilities are available in big hospitals only. PAGE 165 Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) including Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)3 What are RTIs/STIs and how are they spread? Many women suffer sexual infection, including abnormal discharges through the vagina, ulcers and sores in the genital region and pelvic infections. Men also generally have sexual infections. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections of the reproductive organs that are caused by various germs. Though RTIs can occur both in men and women, they are more common in women, because their body structure and functions make it easier for germs to enter. RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Reproductive organs can also get infected because of trauma during delivery, unhygienic practices during delivery and abortions, as well as overgrowth of germs normally found in the vagina. Poor general health, poor genital hygiene and early start of sexual activity are all factors that can make women prone to these infections. Many women suffer from reproductive health problems. Women are more vulnerable to these infections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. sexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk. PAGE 166 22 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Why are these diseases not addressed? Women are usually too shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers.

They have been taught to silently suffer problems related to sex. There is also a fear that if a woman is found to have RTIs, especially STDs, she will be labelled a ‘loose woman’. There is a reluctance to seek medical treatment because of inadequate sex education and less access to medical care. The ‘decision-makers’ at home, like the mother-in-law, would allow a woman to be taken to a health worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems or infertility, but not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal discharge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs. RTIs have been badly neglected because they do not kill the person directly. They usually remain inside a woman’s body, giving her chronic abdominal and back pain or making her infertile. Many women keep on suffering and remain silent. Symptoms of RTIs In woman \\uf06e Abnormal vaginal discharge, which has bad smell and more quantity than usual \\uf06e Ulcers or sores over the external genitals \\uf06e Lower abdominal pain because of pelvic infection In man \\uf06e Discharge from the penis \\uf06e Ulcers The presence of RTIs/STIs could also be indicated in men and women by the presence of: \\uf06c Pain or bleeding during intercourse \\uf06c Painful swelling in the groin \\uf06c Burning pain on passing urine \\uf06c Itching around the genitals Unless treated early, RTIs/STIs can lead to several complications, ranging from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility, to increased risk of HIV infections, ectopic pregnancy, cancer of the cervix and death. There can be pregnancy-related complications like premature deliveries, low PAGE 167 23 birth weight babies, stillbirths, abortions or birth defects. Newborns can also get eye infection from the mother’s birth canal, eventually leading to blindness and pneumonia. Abnormal vaginal discharge Usually discharge can be normal if it is for short time and without other symptoms like itching or pain.

It is not only due to having sex with many but also because many people stay away from homes and families for long periods of time, e.g. truck drivers. Women are more affected by HIV/AIDS in India as this is directly related to her economic and social status and gender inequalities. The existing social and gender norms have great impact on sexual activity and risk behaviour of men and women, which affect women more than men. Women also find it difficult to motivate their partners to use condoms or approach services for treatment of infections. In our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place through the sexual route. There are no “high risk groups” but there are some people who have high-risk behaviour. HIV/AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour. The window period After exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12 weeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period to get an HIV test done. AIDS is the disease AIDS may occur many years after getting HIV positive, but the person is infected during this period.

When breasts start to develop, one may notice small, tender lumps under one or both nipples that will get bigger over the next few years. When breasts first begin to develop, it is not unusual for one breast to be larger than the other. However, as they develop, they will be alike in size and shape. Hair: Soft hair will start to grow in the p ubic area (the area between legs). This hair will eventually become thick and very curly. Hair grows under the arms and on the legs. Body shape: Hips get wider and waist w ill get smaller. Body will also begin to build up fat in the stomach, buttocks, and legs. This is normal and gives body the curves of a woman. Body size: Arms, legs, hands, and feet m ay grow faster than the rest of the body. Skin: Skin may get more oily. This is b ecause glands are growing too.

Erections occur when the penis gets stiff and hard - sometimes for no reason. This is normal. Body will also begin to produce sperm during puberty. This means that during an erection, adolescents may also experience ejaculation. This occurs when semen (made up of sperm and other fluids) is released through the penis.

PAGE 175 Helping Adolescent Girls to Take Care of Themselves during Menstruation6 Staying clean Generally girls living in small towns and cities use sanitary pads for protection during menstrual period, if they can afford them. These are readymade soft cotton pads worn inside the underwear to catch the blood as it leaves the vagina. These pads should not be reused. Some girls prefer to make their own pads out of folded cloth or wads of cotton. These pads must always be clean and dry when worn. They should be changed several times a day and disposed of by burning outdoors in a large empty tin. If cloth is used, they should be washed well with soap and water and dried in the sun. Sun light is the cheapest disinfectant available in nature. In villages there are certain restrictions imposed on adolescents during menstruation. Those restrictions (Don’ts), which are harmful should be discouraged, such as not taking bath during menstruation or not doing any physical work. It is advisable to wash outer genitals well with water every day to remove any blood that is left. PAGE 176 32 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Changes in bleeding Sometimes, the ovary does not release an egg. When this happens, the body makes less hormone, which can cause changes in how often and how much a woman bleeds. Girls whose monthly bleeding has just begun – or women who have recently stopped breastfeeding – may bleed only every few months, or have very little or too much bleeding.

This is an illness, which affects the brain. The victim fears water. This is due to severe spasm during swallowing. No cure is available for rabies. Anti Ra bies Va ccine (ARV) immediately after the dog bite can prevent the fatal illness. These vaccines are available in government hospitals. Not all dogs are rabid. Germs are present in the saliva of infected dogs. Some dogs get the infection from wild animals such as wolf or tiger. The infected dog passes it on to the other dogs. All infected animals finally die and may infect others in the meantime. Controlling stray dogs is the key to prevent rabies. Monkeys and other animals can also be infectious if they are rabid due to such bites. Very effective and simple first aid for any dog bite is to: \\uf06e Wash the wound with soap and water thoroughly. This is most important. \\uf06e Do not disturb the wound. Leave it open. Tie a loose dressing and advise to consult doctor/other staff in hospital. 5 Dog and Other Animal Bites PAGE 198 19 How dangerous is the bite? People will ask you if the bite is dangerous. A bite can cause illness only if the animal itself is infected. First symptoms of rabies in bitten person may appear early within 10 days or more after the bite. Rabies infection is likely if a pet dog dies within 10 days of the bite or if it shows any signs of rabies. Even a scratch on the skin may give rabies infection. Each wound is important. We can decide the risk of exposure as follows: Mild: Licks on normal skin, scratches without blood, drinking raw milk of s uspect cattle. Moderate: Licks on fresh cuts, scratches with blood oozing, minor wounds f ewer than five, all wounds except those on face, neck, head, palms and fingers. Severe: All bites and scratches with oozing blood on neck, face, palms, f ingers, face and head, Lacerated wounds on any part of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals. If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe. Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The'}, {'id': 115, 'text': 'of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals. If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe. Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The effect of ARV reduces after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite, fresh vaccination is necessary. Rabies in dogs: Abnormal behaviour Identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. Remember that there are two types of rabid dogs - the aggressive and the silent. The aggressive DOG AND OTHER ANIMAL BITES PAGE 199 20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA kind keep biting and attacking humans and animals. They may refuse feeds but bite at wood or iron objects. They look ferocious. There is profuse salivation. Usually rabid animals act strangely. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes restless or irritable or attacking. Their mouth dribbles and froths and this fluid is highly infectious. An originally aggressive dog may turn docile. The silent type languishes to death in neglected places. Wild animals may look friendly and turn to habitations. In case there are such problems in your area these need to be addressed and Gram Panchayats have to play the key role. Immunizing dogs Immunization of dogs is essential. The protection given by vaccines used in the government veterinary services lasts for six months. Protection by newer vaccines lasts for one year. Those who handle dogs also need immunization every six months. A common problem is whether to use the milk of an animal bitten by a suspected dog or animal. The rabies germ is not reported in the milk of animals. It is completely destroyed by boiling, so milk of such animals is not harmful. However, the saliva of the animal will contain germs if infected by rabies. The key issue is to avoid direct contact of saliva of such animals. Your role and responsibilities : \\uf06e Wash the site of bite with soap and water thoroughly. \\uf06e Refer all cases of dog/other animal bites to facility where an anti-rabies vaccine is available. \\uf06e Advise people to get pet dogs vaccinated against rabies.

In any case, our priority should be to give first aid and take the person to hospital at the earliest. Inform the doctor about any information by the woman on the burn injury being intentional.

The immediate first aid for all kinds of burns is to pour plenty of cold water on the affected part, except on acid burns. This helps to reduce damage by absorbing heat from the skin. It also reduces pain to some extent. Water also helps by separating burning clothes from the skin. Many people wrongly believe that water causes blisters on the skin and instead they wrap the victim in blankets. This puts the fire off after some seconds, but does not absorb the heat. Water is far more effective than a blanket because it cools instantly. If you are using water-soaked folds of clothes, place them on the burnt part and change them every three minutes. Help the victim to drink as much water as possible. This helps to overcome the shock caused by fluid loss from the body.

The knowledge about these remedies will be useful for ASHAs for their day-to-day work in community. Iron-deficiency disorders Ayurveda has simple remedies to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia. Use of green leafy vegetables like spinach, Punarnnava , Sigru and fruits like Amalki , Dadim , dry grapes etc. in daily diet is important to prevent blood deficiency. ‘Mandookparni’ fried in ghee is also indicated to increase the RBC. Therapeutically, use of ‘Punarnnavadi mandura’ with water or buttermilk is indicated for minor and moderate anaemia. Anaemia in girls is a common cause for amenorrhoea. Therapeutically use of ‘Rajapravartini Vati’ 500mg. two tabs per day upto the onset of menstruation is beneficial in the condition. Three gms. powder of equal quantity of black tila (sesame), Shunti and ghritakumari (aloe) and one gm. jaggery with tepid water twice a day or decoction of above drugs including jaggery in the dose of 10-20 ml. twice a day is indicated for scanty menstruation.

Homoeopathic medicines improve absorption and thereby help in iron intake as supplement or from food rich in iron. Commonly used 7 AYUSH PAGE 204 25 homoeopathic medicines for iron deficiency anaemia are given below with their indications. \\uf06e Arsenic album: Anaemia due to malaria, excessive prostration, oedema, violent and irregular palpitation. \\uf06e Calcarea carbonicum: Palpitation & tachycardia, vertigo, anorexia, nausea, eructation; Pale, weak fatigue, lassitude, easily tired; Headache and heaviness at morning, profuse sweating on head. \\uf06e China: Chief remedy for anaemia resulting from loss of fluids, as in lactation or haemorrhage, or from all exhausting discharges, such as menstrual flow, long-lasting diarrhoea. \\uf06e Ferrum metallicum: Paleness of the face and puffiness of the extremities, weakness, easily exhausted. \\uf06e Ferrum phosphoricum: Anaemia and chlorosis; it removes the underlying dyscrasia giving rise to the anaemic or chlorotic conditions and cures the trouble. \\uf06e Kali carbonicum: Anaemia after loss of fluid or vitality; Pallor; Aversion to be alone; Backache, weakness, profuse menses, irregular with clots, weak before menstruation; Backache; Vertigo. \\uf06e Natrum muriaticum: Anaemic and debilitated conditions due to loss of fluids, especially in women who suffer from menstrual disorders. \\uf06e Phosphorus: Anaemia; Morning diarrhoea; Restlessness; Weakness and prostration; Nervousness, debility and trembling; Nausea and vomiting. \\uf06e Pulsatilla: Anaemic condition produced by large or continued doses of iron; System is relaxed and worn out; Patient suffering from gastric and menstrual derangements.

In children the medicine could be given in the dose of 5 ml. twice daily. Qurs-e-Damvi two tablets with butter is also useful for this purpose. Iron deficiency disorders can be managed as well as prevented by a proper intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.AYUSH PAGE 205 26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Iron rich foods'}, {'id': 119, 'text': 'by a proper intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.AYUSH PAGE 205 26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA Iron rich foods Green leafy vegetables, spinach, ragi, jaggery, drumstick, dates raisins, amla and figs etc. For enhancing the absorption of iron, one must take whole grams, sprouts, fresh fruits and fresh raw vegetables. Intake of tea, coffee and other preservatives in the food interfere in the absorption of iron. So by avoiding all the beverages, we can enhance the iron absorption. Diseases of gastro-intestinal system Gastro-intestinal system plays an important role in the normal and abnormal states of health. Ayurveda describe that the use of wholesome diet is the only factor that promotes the healthy growth of man. Food should be taken at proper time, when the body feels light after the digestion of previous meals, after the clearance of bowels and urine and when the mind is free from worries. Clean and hygienic food should be taken in optimum quantity. The food should not be too hot or too cold, too heavy or too light. Diseases of the gastro-intestinal system are primarily caused by the food and water that we take. The root causes of many chronic diseases are also related to factors derived from partially digested or undigested food materials. Therefore, the disorders arising from gastro-intestinal tract should be promptly managed. If digestive capacity is low simple remedies like ‘Trikatu’ and ‘Panchakola’ powders 2 gms.twice daily are indicated for use along with warm water before meals. In abdominal pain due to indigestion, Hinguvachadi Churna, Lashunadi Vati, Chitrakadi Vati etc. is indicated in the dose of two tablets twice daily with warm water. Constipation is a common symptom of many illnesses, which can be managed by powder of ‘Triphala’ (equal quantity of fruits of amla, harada and baheda) 5 gms. with tepid water at bedtime. 8-10 dried grapes of bigger variety boiled with about 250 ml. of milk is also indicated at bedtime for relieving constipation.

Rational drugs Ayurveda explains the therapeutics as basically two kinds – one kind is promotive of vigour in the healthy; the other, destructive of the disease in the ailing. A drug while inducing therapeutic effect, should not evoke untoward effects. In this regard, herbal drugs like Ashwagandha, Shatavari, Guduchi, Vasaka, Hareetaki, Amalki, Vibheetaki, Ginger etc. could be considered as safe drugs. Some common AYUSH medicines We have seen that the knowledge about the use of medicinal plants obtained from our surroundings is valuable.

Theprocess of knowing oneself is continuous and we need to review our strengthsand limitations from time to time, which will help us to change. We need toconstantly grow in our capacities in order to ensure that we are able tofacilitate the process of development and empowerment at the community level too. However before we attempt to empower the community we need to know whether we are empowered ourselves. Remember we were created by nature with a unique body, soul and mind. All human beings have different characteristics and personalities. The externalenvironment influences our personality. As women, directly or indirectly, weare told that ours is a subordinate role. We usually do not question this kind of attitude towards us. In fact, we are not trained to question the daily inequality that we face. We accept the social norms without any questioning.A woman who questions them, is viewed as “out of control.” Let us understand how this attitude affects our personality. In our Indian society a woman is identified by her relationship with others, like that of adaughter, mother, wife, etc. Being brought up in a patriarchal society, a woman internalises these norms, which makes her devalue herself. She does not think of herself as worthwhile and neglects all her needs. All this affectsher self-esteem and overall personality. PAGE 218 6As a woman you must have experienced that you are expected to be humble, to put your needs after that of other people, to learn to say “yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval. This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your journey as an ASHA you'}, {'id': 127, 'text': '“yes” all thetime to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seekconstant approval. This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your journey as an ASHA you need to first identify your own needs in order to be able to understand and appreciate the needs of others. Let Us Understand the Meaning of Self-Esteem Self-esteem refers to the perception that you have about yourself. It is about how much you value yourself and how important you think you are. zIt is about being confident about and satisfied with your own self. zIt is about a reasonable sense of your self-worth. zIt is about having faith in yourself and your abilities. zIt is about being pleased with yourself and with your achievements. Remember, it is NOT about zConvincing yourself that you are of value zFeeling confident or feeling good when other people praise you zHaving beautiful features Let us examine the characteristics of a person with healthy self-esteem: zSelf-confidence zAbility to express true feelings zAbility to recognise and value own accomplishments zAbility to forgive self and others zAbility to welcome change If you do not take care of yourself, respect who you are and respect your own needs, you will not be able to take care of others and respect their needs. Give some time to know yourself. There is a need to go through the process of self-realisation. It will help you to build up a healthy self-esteem. Maintain a diary about your dealing with others and yourself during the day.The process of understanding the self and self-realisation is continuos and one needs to do it systematically. PAGE 219 7Think about the following questions. Answering them will help you in self- reflection. More questions may be added. zWhat are some of the difficulties that I face in order to complete my work? zWhat are some of the changes which I will practice if I have to deal with this situation again? (The changes can be related to behaviour, way of working, etc.) zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? zWhat did I do today which has made me happy? Remember , each day must contribute to your overall goals in'}, {'id': 128, 'text': 'way of working, etc.) zWhat did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? zWhat did I do today which has made me happy? Remember , each day must contribute to your overall goals in some way. Each day must in some way be connected to the rest of your life. Each day shouldcontribute to your general welfare, happiness and empowerment. This will also contribute to the development of your community. We have 24 hours in a day, out of which we spend about seven hours sleeping. Out of the remaining17 hours, we need to think about how many we actually spend on self-development. As an ASHA we suggest that you initially need atleast half anhour everyday for yourself in order to grow and develop. You may increasethis period as you get more familiar with this practice. We need to plan for our self-development from today. You may use the tools given here for help.

List them in order of priority 1 23 How will I improve myself? What difficulties do I foresee while implementing my plan?How will I overcome these difficulties? Whose support will I require? How will I monitor my self-development plan?Suggestions for monitoring my self-development plan:Review your daily performance as you close the day. Note the efforts you made for self-development as per your plan. If you have not been able todo it, think about the reasons. Reflect on what you will do differently so that you do not come up with these reasons again. Try to maintain a diary and write down the important steps that you have taken to develop yourself, what difficulties you faced and how youovercame them. You may share your self-development plan with a person whom you trust. You may take regular feedback from that person to learn whether she/he has noticed the changes in you. Note: Once you achieve what you had planned, develop a new plan and follow the same steps . PAGE 221 9Some Tips to Achieve your Goal zBe passionate about your goal.

Unlike a common person, an excellent person makes great demands on herself/himself. zAs an ASHA you are unique.You are talented and skilled and, therefore, you have been selected to serve the community. Make maximum use of your potential and make sure that you achieve your goals. You need to have astrong will. A strong WILL can move mountains. PAGE 222 10 ASHA as a Health Activist Your role as an activist to improve the access of marginalised and disadvantaged community members to public health care services is very important. Before we discuss your role in detail, let us visualise a situation. Rami lives next to your house. She is five months pregnant. She is very weak, but has not registered her name with the ANM. Rami does not receive any healthcare services. Her husband is a drunkard. Everyday he drinks and shouts at Rami, sometimes even beats her. You feel uncomfortable and want to stop this. You discuss this with other women in your neighbourhood. They understand your point of view. Together you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectivelygo and stop him. You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens again, you'}, {'id': 130, 'text': 'your point of view. Together you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectivelygo and stop him. You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens again, you would inform the police. Next day when the ANM (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife) comes, you take Rami with you and register her name. Well, admittedly a real situation does not get handled this smoothly, but you will never know just how it will fare unless you try it out. You need to take the first step towards bringing about change. Initially you will be alone but slowly, with your efforts of creating awareness through one-to-one approachor by addressing the issue in the village meetings you will have many to support you in your endeavour. PAGE 223 11The above effort is an example to explain “activism” As an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist. So it is important to understand how it is done. Read the following real life examples ofactivism. Anti Arrack Movement In 1991, women from Dubagunta, Nellore district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, drove away the liquor contractors from their village. This is said to have been the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor)Movement, which finally led to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on16 January 1995. The main participants in the early struggle were poor rural women, predominantly from scheduled castes and backward classes, supported by voluntary organisations and, later, by politicians from opposition parties. This is not just a story, it actually happened. It is about what a miracle that common women were able to achieve collectively. It is about a communityof hard-working women who laboured in the fields to earn their living.Unfortunately, all their labour was wasted on arrack and toddy (locallymade liquor). The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the hard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), inexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris. After drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making their'}, {'id': 131, 'text': 'liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, theyincurred debts or stole household articles like goblets, plates or even theirwives’ saris. After drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making their lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to gostraight to these shops in the evening after returning from work. Theycame home late at night, completely drunk.They would hand over somemoney for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his father to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community was embarrassed when her relatives visited her houseand, to her shame, were scared away from the village by the obscenelanguage of her closest neighbor, a heavy drinker. She felt ashamed andthought that the village would be a much better place without arrack. Everyday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women discussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached the village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders.They expressed their problem and asked them to get r emove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the Sarpanch, although agree able, were unable to do anything PAGE 224 12The next day one hundred of the women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come intothe village’, they told the cart driver strongly in unison and stood in frontof it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them offered him a rupee to doso.The driver got scared and left the village. Then a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded that it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police were called. They said that all those who bid at auctions have theright to sell arrack.The women stood unmoved. They said that they wouldgo to the Collector and will not keep quiet if arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet. They made several plans, butnothing worked and they gave up. These events gave strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and'}, {'id': 132, 'text': \"arrack was sold in theirvillage. The arrack contractors got cold feet. They made several plans, butnothing worked and they gave up. These events gave strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and struggled strongly to get rid of arrack from theirvillage. The story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of the district. In the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the community through puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They also shared the story of Dubagunta village. Women of other villages had also suffered a lot. There were quarrels every day in their families.They survived only by taking refuge in neighbouringhouses. Daily, for two-three hours they had to put up with this situation.There was not enough food for their children. So, women in other villages considered doing in their village what the women in Dubagunta had done earlier. The members of three literacy centres discussed this issue. Theteachers supported and guided them. Finally, they also attacked the arrackshops. They too managed to stop the arrack business in their village.The women in Dubagunta initiated and led a movement in which women from other villages joined and ultimately the situation changed for the better. Chipko Movement The Chipko Movement was initiated in the Uttarakhand region of India by a group of villagers who opposed the commercial cutting down of trees. Themovement was led by women who were influenced by Mahatma Gandhi. For rural women, saving the environment is crucial to their economic survival. As primary food, fuel and water gatherers, women have strong interests in reversing deforestation, desertification and water pollution.The women made a living in the Himalayan foothills, using its forests assources of food and fuel. They faced a particularly severe challenge in the PAGE 225 131960s, when India, to enhance economic development, started to cut trees to export the wood and earn foreign exchange. As a consequence, the hillsoil washed away, causing landslides, floods and silting in the rivers belowthe hills. Crops and houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies. Against these harmful deforestation policies a\"}, {'id': 133, 'text': \"houses too were destroyed, and women had to slog evenmore for their fuel, fodder and water. All in all, it was the women whowere the main victims of India's deforestation policies. Against these harmful deforestation policies a movement called Chipko was born. “Chipko” in Hindi means to cling, reflecting the protesters’ maintechnique of throwing their arms around the tree trunks marked to be cut,and refusing to move. In a remote hill town a contractor had been giventhe right by the state to fell 3000 trees for a sporting goods store. The areawas already becoming barren. The women of the village decided to fight against this. When the woodcutters were scheduled to arrive, the men were lured away from the village leaving the women at home, busy withhousehold work. As soon as the woodcutters appeared, the alarm wassounded and the village's female leader, a widow in her 50s, collected 27women and rushed to the forest. The women pleaded with the woodcuttercalling the forest their “maternal home” and explaining the consequences of felling trees. The woodcutters shouted at and abused the women and threatened them with guns. The women in turn threatened to hug themarked trees and die with them. It worked! The frightened labourers leftand the contractor backed off. In 1974, women in a nearby area used thesame tree-hugging technique in order to protest against the clearing oftheir forestlands. Similarly, in your community you may come across several issues that require to be addressed. For example, the anganwadi is not functioning well; childrenand women are not receiving their entitlement of supplementary food; themidday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly. It could be thatwidow pension is not being received in spite of all the required formalitiesbeing completed by the widows of the village. So, to bring change in such situations, some collective action is required. However, activism or protest is not the first step in any process towards change. First, one needs to understand the situation and find out if thingscan be changed through simply drawing the attention of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue. For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter in order to resolve it.\"}, {'id': 134, 'text': 'of the authoritiesthrough letters, appeals or direct dialogue. For instance, you can meet someone of importance concerning the issue, like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the schoolteacher, the Talati and discuss the matter in order to resolve it. Activism may not always be the best method of changing the world but it can be quite useful under the right circumstances. It gives voice to a cause. Activism is particularly useful/effective when you have many people who are affected with the same issues and the situation needs to be changed. If you PAGE 226 14decide to initiate a movement along with the people to change a situation, first see if there is some organisation or institute working on the same issueand try and seek their support or join them in their efforts. As an ASHA there are Some Key Principles that You Need to Keep in Mind in Activism to Bring about Change 1. Identify and work on the issues that are most crucial and urgent and are affecting the larger community. 2. Involve the people who are affected and ensure that they cooperate with you. 3. Let it be a people’s movement and struggle rather than an individual effort4. Mobilising the community takes time and will be energy consuming. Do not lose patience and hope. PAGE 227 15 Values of ASHA For every individual, values are the central guiding force for all behaviour and attitudes. Culture, experience, education, religion, law, language and media influence values. It is also important to know that values can change. Whileworking on social issues, we are basically working with the attitudes andbehaviours of the community and the programme implementors for a positiveand desired change. Hence, it becomes very important to address the valuesof individuals for social development. Every individual has her/his own values. There is noth ing like right or wrong. Generally, they are received from our parents, our society and oursurroundings. Values shape our personality and identity and are directly connected with our vision of life. They guide us to decide our goal and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are'}, {'id': 135, 'text': 'and act onit. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can alwayschoose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are lost and confused. For example, whether to spend time in gossiping or in my work will depend on myvalues. Values remain in the subconscious mind and act like red and green traffic lights.They tell us what we should or should not do. Values are a set of beliefsabout what is good and desirable. They are based on assumptions about how the world works. Our idea of what is the right thing to do in a situation comes from these values. PAGE 228 16Some examples of values which are required for social development include: 1. Value of Equality zIn a patriarchal society women are viewed as submissive, weak and soft and men as strong and powerful. Due to this thinking men are given morerecognition, power and respect in the family and society whereas womenare usually viewed in a supportive role. As a result, girls and woman haveless access to resources. For example, girls and women are given less food than boys and men of the family. Men and boys are given more scope to develop themselves, e.g., men are given more opportunity for basic and higher education. Men, usually inherit the properties of the family, while women usually do not get a share. If you believe in patriarchal values you will not see anything wrong if a woman is ill-treated. If you believe in equality you will respect a woman as a person. zIn our society the structure of caste is very strong and people who arefrom a socially advantaged class are in favour of maintaining status quo.Due to the caste structure, certain people of our society do not getopportunities to develop and get the benefits of the mainstream. As an ASHA we have to first understand problems of the poor and marginalised communities. They need to be educated about their rights andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion. 2. Value of Responsibility zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own'}, {'id': 136, 'text': 'andentitlements. Empower them. Encourage them to share their views andfeelings. Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or his class, caste,sex and religion. 2. Value of Responsibility zYour behaviour should be responsible. You should promote your own health and that of your family and community. You may keep your own house clean and throw garbage in the street, which is not responsible behaviour. As a member of the community you need to throw garbage at the designated place so as to prevent infectious diseases. zThe Sarpanch of your village has the power to make decision for thedevelopment of your village. Many times people misuse this power and use it for their own benefit or benefit of their friends, relatives and/or caste.Being responsible for your own self and to the power you are designated with is very important. No system works effectively if all the designated members do not perform their duties effectively and in a coordinated manner. 3. Believe in People’s Knowledge and Experience All people have experience and knowledge. It needs to be respected and valued while making any decision. Never view people as empty vessels needing PAGE 229 17to be filled with knowledge. They should not be viewed as passive recipients. They need to be active in sharing their views while making decisions. Forexample, if pregnant women are not coming forward to get their namesregistered you will need to find out why they are not coming. Ask them tosuggest strategies to increase registration of pregnant women and how theycould contribute to making the strategy work. 4. Values of Trust When people honour each other, there is a trust established that leads tosynergy, interdependence and mutual respect. Gaining the trust of thosearound you is not a difficult or unachievable task. Trust can be created bysharing feelings, thoughts, views and being transparent. Trust is a glue thatholds people together. Some of the values promoted by Mahatma Gandhi zAlways speak the truth zBelieve in the power of non-violence zA person should not be discriminated against on the basis of her or his caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being. zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness. zNever misuse common resources'}, {'id': 137, 'text': 'her or his caste, religion, sex, class or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated as ahuman being. zIf you have made a mistake never be ashamed to apologise or expressregret and ask for forgiveness. zNever misuse common resources like land, water, forests, wood, etc. Itbelongs to every individual on earth and all should have equal access tothese resources. zYou can touch the heart of people if you are committed to serve them. zKeep people at the centre of your activities and believe in the power ofpeople. It is a fact that people who are conscious of their value-based priorities are more fulfilled and happier in their lives. They make more effective decisionsabout their own and their family and community’s growth and development.To know your personal values is to be more aware of who you are, what you want and what you don’t want. As an ASHA, your work is very important. With that you should also value your family and community. You also need to think about what is more importantto you and why. Answering these questions for yourself can be revealing. Insome situations the family may be important and in some it may be thework. One is actually a means to another. Working together may enable you to support your family, providing you an opportunity to develop. Having a family may provide support to your work. Understanding your values enablesyou to move ahead and maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. PAGE 230 18 Understanding the Human Rights andthe Fundamental Rights Every individual needs to have knowledge about their Human and their Fundamental Rights. Usually we do not come across information on this topic.Also, in the past you may not have discussed this topic with others. As anASHA you need to know about rights. It will help you to learn about your andyour community’s rights. It will also help you to take appropriate decisions forthe development of your community. You may be reading about Fundamental and Human Rights for the first time and you may find the information boring. We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make theinformation simple, interesting and relevant. Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not respect you. These include things'}, {'id': 138, 'text': 'We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make theinformation simple, interesting and relevant. Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not respect you. These include things people may have said about you to makeyou feel stupid or silly. For example, some one may have told you, “There is no use talking to you, you will not understand.” Try and remember one or two such hurtful statements/incidents. In 1948, after the global suffering in World War II, all the countries in the world agreed that it would be a more peaceful world if every human beingrespected the dignity of every other human being. As a result, the UniversalHuman Right Declaration came in existence. Our country has also agreed to this Declaration. PAGE 231 19This the set of the Universal Human Rights. zAll human beings are born free and equal. zEveryone should have the same rights and freedom, no matter of what race, sex, or colour she or he may be. It should not matter where wewere born, what language we speak or what religion or political opinions we have, or whether we are rich or poor. zEveryone has the right to live, to be free and to feel safe. zAdult men and women have the right to marry and start a family, without anyone trying to stop them because of their race, country or religion.Both have to agree to the marriage and both have equal rights in getting married, during the marriage, and if and when they decide to end it. zYou may believe what you want to believe, have ideas about right and wrong, and believe in any religion you want, and you may change yourreligion if you want, without interference. The entire list of Human Rights is long and we shall not be discussing it here. Let us now understand what are the Fundamental Rights. The Fundamental Rights As an Indian, our county has granted us six Fundamental Rights. They are: zRight to Equality zRight to Freedom zRight against Exploitation zRight to Freedom of Religion zCultural and Educational Rights zRight to Constitutional Remedies Let us understand these rights in detail. The Right to Equality The state cannot discriminate against a citizen on the'}, {'id': 139, 'text': 'Freedom zRight against Exploitation zRight to Freedom of Religion zCultural and Educational Rights zRight to Constitutional Remedies Let us understand these rights in detail. The Right to Equality The state cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of race, caste, sex, religion or place of birth. The state also cannot discriminate againstanyone in matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs.But the Right to Equality specifies certain expectations. The Constitution has a special provision in the form of reserve posts while guaranteeing the Right to Equality. Reserved posts are provided for scheduled castes, scheduled tribesand other backward classes. Similarly, special provisions are provided forwomen and children. The main reason for having these exceptions is that in our society various kinds of inequalities still exist. You must have noticed how people become victims of unequal treatment. Extending such protections does not contradict PAGE 232 20the spirit of the Right to Equality. Such a policy is known as ‘Positive Discrimination’ or a ‘Protective Discrimination’ policy. Right to Freedom The Right to Freedom is a cluster of the following six freedoms: Freedom of speech and expression Freedom to assemble peacefully and without armsFreedom to form associations or unions Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India Freedom to live and settle in any part of IndiaFreedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The aim of the Right to Freedom is the development of a person. She/he should enjoy her/his rights democratically, and She/he should be able to live a healthy and civic life. This right is very crucial for democracy. Right Against Exploitation When we accept everyone as human, we cannot treat anyone as a ‘slave’. She/he cannot be kept in captivity. She/he cannot be forced into labour.Citizens are protected against such exploitation by the law. Earlier there waspractice of bonded or forced labour. Sometimes such traditions were carriedon for generations. The forced labour system has now been abolished. Practice of this system is a crime which is punishable by law. In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and'}, {'id': 140, 'text': 'law. In the same way, if children below the age of 14 years are asked to do work beyond their capacity, and if they are employed in factories, mines or suchhazardous places, it is called exploitation and is a crime under the Abolition ofChild Labour Act. Right to Freedom of Religion The Right to freedom of religion provides religious freedom to all the citizens of India. All religions are equal before the state and no religion can be given preference over the other by the state. However, religious freedom also has to be observed under certain limitations. The state can regulate the non-religious activities of any religious communityin the interest of public order, morality and health. Cultural and Educational Rights India is a country of multiple religions, languages and cultures. Any community which has a language and script of its own, has the right to conserve and develop them. All minorities, religious or linguistic groups, can set up their PAGE 233 21own educational institutions. In doing so, they may preserve and develop their own culture. Right to Constitutional Remedies This right empowers citizens to approach the court in cases of denial of anyof the Fundamental Rights. The court of law stands as a guard against theviolation of these rights. Under this right, it is the duty of the Judiciary to attend to all complaints pertaining to violation or rights. Directive Principles Apart from these there are some Directive Principles of State Policy that incorporate such rights as are required for the overall development of human kind. zThese Principles include rights like the right to work, right to equal wage for equal work, right to an adequate livelihood, right to free and compulsory education of children up to the age of 14 years etc. zThe state should take measures to preserve the good health of labourersand minor children and to ensure that they are not forced to undertake any work that harms their health. zThe state should promote public health and animal husbandry. zDecentralisation of power should reach the grassroots level. For that, Panchayati Raj must be established. zThe state should protect the academic and economic benefits of theweaker sections.

Think about the following statements and decide whether your Human and community’s Fundamental Rights are protected. zMy village is safe and secure. All members of the community receive equaltreatment and information about different government schemes and opportunities so as to avail of these services. zMy village provides all its inhabitants equal access to resources, especially water, irrespective of their caste, sex and religion. zWhenever someone violates the rights of another person, the villagecommittee takes note of it, discusses and takes appropriate decision andaction with the consent of all the committee members, keeping in view the policies and procedures of the committee.

Are your attending the Gram Panchayat? zNo one in your village is subjected to degrading treatment or punishment. zMy village Panchayat has people from diverse backgrounds, religion andcultures. There are some women members in our Panchayat. There are33% seats reserved in the Panchayat for women. zI can express my political, religious and cultural ideas and beliefs to myfamily and community without fear of discrimination. zMembers of my village actively participate in decision-making processesrelated to village and community development through the village GramSabha. zThe village members and labourers are paid as per minimum wage norms. zBoth men and women are paid equal wages for equal work.

As an ASHA, if you do not know the answer to the abovementioned questions, get the information from the community by discussingthese matters with them. You are a critical link between the community andthe Health Facility. To exercise the community’s Right to Health you alsoneed to monitor, identify gaps and articulate their health care needs to the appropriate health care providers. Therefore, you need to be well aware of the health structure, systems and its operational issues and standards. Different health services are available at various levels. Let us first learn about them. Usually the health services are available at the state, district,cluster and village levels. Village level At the village level there is a Sub-Centre. It provides the following health services under various programmes: PAGE 237 25Reproductive and Child Health Programme (RCH). Under this programme the following services are provided. Maternal health zAntenatal care zIntra-natal care zPostnatal care zEssential newborn care zJanani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) zNutrition counselling and referral Child health zImmunisation zVitamin A Refer to ASHA Book 2 for details on maternal and child health care services Family welfare zPromotion and supply of contraceptives zIUD insertions zFollow-up services for permanent methods zCounselling Adolescent health zAdolescent-friendly health support and referral Refer to ASHA Book 3 for details on contraceptives and adolescent health services Community at large zPreventive and prompt referral action for Malaria, Dengue, Chikun Guniea, Japanese Encephalitis, Kala Azar, Filariasis, and communicable diseases, and in the control of epidemics. zTreatment for minor ailments such as ordinary fever , diarrhea/ dysentery /vomiting, worms infestation and first aid. zAppropriate and prompt referral to the nearest Primary Health Centre (PHC) or Community Health Centre (CHC) if the patient is in a critical condition. zDisease surveillance and reporting for all National Health Programmes and endemic diseases.

As an ASHA you need to be well-versed with servicesavailable at the Sub-Centre and the PHC. Knowing only about the services isalso not enough. Under the Rural Health Mission great emphasis is being put on the quality of health care. As an ASHA you need to make sure that your community members receive quality health care. There are certain normswhich need to be followed by the health service providers and health careservice institutions provide quality care to patients. Generally, patients do notknow about these. As a result, they often get poor quality services.

It may be a great freedom fighter , a popular politician or a renowned religious guru. All thesepeople have some common qualities, they alter a challenging situation or a problem into an opportunity. Leadership can be defined as mobilising people and resources towards achieving valued goals. Through knowledge and experience most people have the potential to become a leader in any given situation. Effective leadership in the community requires skills like team building, communication, conflict resolution, negotiation and advocacy for change. As an ASHA you often have to play the role of a leader. Hence it is important to understand the meaning of leadership and qualities, which will help you in playing your leadership roles effectively. Leadership means zto be responsible zto inspire people to follow you zto be non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions zto show confidence, assertiveness, enthusiasm, passion and accountability zto have skills for getting things'}, {'id': 149, 'text': 'roles effectively. Leadership means zto be responsible zto inspire people to follow you zto be non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions zto show confidence, assertiveness, enthusiasm, passion and accountability zto have skills for getting things done in cooperation with others Leadership PAGE 245 33Gandhiji was a great leader. He took people along with him to achieve freedom for our country. Let us see the principles that he followed as a leader. Courage: Courage to stand up and be accountable for your beliefs and opinions If your community’s Right to Health is violated, as an ASHA you need to have courage to bring it to the notice of the concerned stakeholders. For example,if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting thehouses of socially backward families have courage to tell her that you havenoted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. If she does not listen, be ready to inform the Sarpanch, SHG members and even the medical officer. Continue your efforts till you ensure that she visits all thepeople in your village regularly. Responsibility: Carry out your role and responsibility honestly As a leader you need to be responsible, first person for your self and then foryour community. As an ASHA you are given specific roles and responsibilities.You should inform your community of these. This will prove useful in two ways: zIf they are aware about your roles they will be able to bring it to your notice if you are not performing it effectively. zThey will also support you in carrying out your roles and responsibilitiesmore effectively Encouragement: Invite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care Every individual needs encouragement. As a leader, whenever you meet anyone read the unwritten words on their forehead “I am important.” Encouragement comes by involving community members in the process whenavailing for them their entitlements from the public health system or bygiving them some responsibility to improve the health environment in thecommunity.

Improvement: Constantly enhancing your competencies As a leader, an ASHA should constantly improve her knowledge and skills. Be aware of any new decision made regarding the delivery of health services and any new schemes declared. Be in constant dialogue with the ANM as she is agood source of information. Your skills will improve by practising them. Youmay fail too. From failures you learn what should not be done. If you arerepeating your mistakes it means that you are not learning. By learning youwill be able to stand out. PAGE 246 34Leadership Style People adopt different leadership styles. The two common styles are zAuthoritarian zParticipatory Authoritarian leaders do not come forward for cooperation or collaboration. They are heavily task-oriented people. They expect people to do what they are told without question or debate. They are usually intolerant of what they do not agree with. It is difficult for community members to contribute theirviews or empower themselves under this kind of leadership. A participatory leader creates a positive environment in which all members can reach their highest potential. They encourage the community to reachthe set goals as effectively as possible, while also working tirelessly to strengthen the bonds among various members. They usually form and lead some of the most productive teams. As an ASHA, it is the most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership style. Some of the characteristics of participatory leadership are given below: Leaders establish goals and set the direction As an ASHA you need to articulate what is an achievable goal in your village.You should establish your goal and direction by involving your community as to how, where and when it would be completed. For example, there should not be any maternal death in the coming year in your village, or, All children of your village should be immunised in the next sixmonths. Leaders affirm and articulate values As leaders we need to have certain values like honesty, hardwork,trusteworthiness etc. You have to demonstrate these values in your actions. You may communicate to your community members that you are hardworking but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you. For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be fully immunised.'}, {'id': 151, 'text': 'members that you are hardworking but if you do not show it in your actions people will not believe you. For example, you are aware that every eligible child in the village needs to be fully immunised. But when the ANM comes for immunisation you are notpresent.Then will people believe that you are a hardworking person? Leaders have high standards and high expectations As an ASHA you should be firm about receiving high quality health care services from the sub-centre and the PHC for your village community. Make sure that the ANM performs her role professionally. As an ASHA you should also provide her support to carry out her role effectively. For example, PAGE 247 35inform the community about the date and place of the health camp or day of visit of the ANM and encourage them to be present at the camp. If the health service provider ill-treats a community member, take a note of it and confront the person concerned. Leaders are accountable and responsible As an ASHA you are accountable, both to the community and the health careprovider. Be an effective link between both of them by sharing information from one end to the other. Some tips to be accountable: zYou will gain personal power and the ability to get results if you assume accountability in all situations, even if you do not immediately see theresults. zComplain only to the person who can do something about it. zConcentrating on blaming others or complaining will reduce your energyand the energy of people around you. zVenting your feelings once or twice is a good stress managementtechnique. Being constantly critical of them has no positive outcome. “Focus on action and not on blame” “If it is to be, it is up to me”“Light a candle instead of cursing the darkness ” Ultimately, you are the one responsible for yourself. You play a crucial part in every situation in your life. What you are today is a result of your choice. This is accountability. Leaders involve others in decision-making As a leader you have to make various decisions. A community leader rarelymakes a decision alone.

By law, a decision, which affects the communityneeds to be taken along with the community members. The community needsto feel ownership of decisions taken. Only then they will do their best to achieve what they have decided. For example, as an ASHA you have to articulate and assert yourself for your community’s health needs. You need to decide and prioritise the health needsof the community along with community members and jointly develop a planof action. This will encourage them to join hands with you to take necessaryaction. Leaders motivates others To achieve the goal of the Right to Health you need the support of your PAGE 248 36community members, the Panchayat, SHG etc. As a leader, you need to motivate your community to join hands with you. Motivation comes through zBeing in regular contact with them zSharing necessary information regularly zGiving them responsibility zThanking them for their support zGiving them credit for their efforts z Appreciating them honestly in public Leaders achieve unity As a leader you need to promote unity among your community members andbetween the community members and health care providers. Unity can be achieved by listening to everyone’s points of view while taking decisions. Do not make anyone feel neglected since later they may become difficult personsto manage. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership of the goal that you have set as an ASHA for your village. Leaders serve as role models Leaders have followers. Therefore, it is very important that all your actions are responsible. For example, as an ASHA you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the lifeof woman in your village, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if required.

Also, the as a leader you need to articulate and explain your point of view. For example, at the village level families are not proactive in preparing for the birth of a child. You need to listen to them about the reasons for theirlack of motivation. Based on their views, explain to them the need for birth preparedness and the likely consequences of poor birth preparedness. Share positive examples where birth preparedness has helped to save a woman’s life. PAGE 249 37Leaders represent the community A leader is the face of the community. As an ASHA, when you discuss the health concerns of your community with the health service provider, you arerepresenting your community. Share their points of view rather than merelyyours. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along with the Panchayat and health and sanitation committee. While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of the poor of your community. Share their feelings and opinions, and make sure that whateverdecision is taken to develop the health plan, reflects their voices. If somesegment of the community has shared that the source of drinking water isnot accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion whiledeveloping a comprehensive health plan for the village. As a leader some of the skills you need to build are zCommunication zDecision-making zNegotiation zCoordination PAGE 250 38 God gave us a mouth and two ears to communicate People failing to communicate create confusion, frustration and problems. Communication is the exchange or two-way flow of information and ideas between two or more persons. Communication is the most important skill to fulfill your role as an ASHA. There are different forms of communication zVerbal communication zNon-verbal communication zWritten communication As an ASHA you need to use all three types of communication. Verbal communication This is the most common mode of communication used. Normally, we think communication is completed once we have orally delivered the message. Butthat is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. Toknow if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/heunderstood the message and take feedback.

Communication Skills PAGE 251 39Some Tips for Effective Verbal Communication zAccuracy zClarity zCorrectness Points to take care of while communicating: zMaintain eye contact with the person with whom you are talking. zBe confident while communicating. Stand or sit confidently. zStick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time. zBe specific, sincere, honest and direct while communicating zShare feelings while communicating. zBe open-minded. This will help you to understand the other person’s point of view. zYour voice should be loud enough so that everyone can hear you. Your pronunciation should be clear. Use words which are easy to understand. Do not use technical words or jargon. zIf someone has something worth mentioning, give them scope to do so.Never forget to compliment/appreciate others. The speaker is assured that you are listening when you use verbal affirmations like, “I see,” I” agree”, “uh, okay, then….” during the conversation at appropriate points. Non-Verbal Communication We all know that communication is not only about words and languages. Evensilence communicates and eyes talk. Hence, it is important to understandthese forms of communication which are referred to as non-verbalcommunication. Here are some non-verbal behavioural aspects which require extra attention. zEye contact : Looking at the person with whom you are talking is an effective way of declaring that you are sincere/honest about what you aresaying and also communicates confidence. zBody posture : The value or weight of your messages will increase if you face the person, stand or sit appropriately close and hold your head erect. zFacial expressions : Express appropriate feelings on your face. Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions. zGestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. zVoice characteristics : The volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should be well modulated.

Hearing'}, {'id': 155, 'text': 'volume, tone, speed of speech and pitch should be well modulated. PAGE 252 40Active Listening is Communication too All of us can hear, but all of us cannot listen. Hearing and listening are not the same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening involves the reception andinterpretation of what is heard. It decodes the sound heard meaningfully.Does a knock on the door sound the same all the time? What if you are aloneand you hear a knock late at night? What happens if you hear a knock whenyou are expecting someone whom you like? Active listening involves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain information, obtain directions, understand others, solve problems, shareinterests, see how the other person feels, or even show support. This type oflistening takes the same amount of, or more, energy than speaking. Itrequires the listener to hear various messages, understand the meaning andthen verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. Following are some of the tips for good listening: zMaintain eye contact zSit or stand in a receptive position, lean forward zEncourage by using positive gestures and words zRemove distractions zUnderstand non-verbal signals zStop talking or doing what you were doing before you began listening zGive time for listening zDo not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking zReflect on the feeling expressed and paraphrase what has been heard zHave patience As an ASHA, keep the following points in mind while communicating with your community. zNever discriminate on the basis of caste and class while communicatingwith the community. Your tone and gesture should not change while talkingto socially and economically disadvantaged community members. Talk tothem with respect and dignity. zA community has immense knowledge and experience. Give people achance to share and use it. Do not treat them like empty vessels. zNever make any comment which emphasises gender inequality. Yourcommunication should be gender-sensitive. zDo not react fast. Listen, assimilate, analyse and then react. PAGE 253 41As an ASHA, you need to keep the following points in mind while communicating with stakeholders zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the'}, {'id': 156, 'text': 'mind while communicating with stakeholders zGive due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. zWhile sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the necessary information, data and evidence. Never generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not want from them, what you want to change and what you want to continue. zBe calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety. zDo not use a blaming tone. You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will affect those around you. And, of course, confidence and assertiveness will help get your message through. A point to note – think before you speak. Written Communication As an ASHA you would need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You also need to document theprocesses and decisions taken during meetings. Let us first learn how to write simply and effectively. Read the following letter: Dear Sir, There are many women in villages in different areas, which is far away from the place where the ANC clinic is organised. Especially in thesummer season, the women cannot travel long distances to the clinicand hence cannot get their ANC check-ups done. If the clinic can be conducted in two areas on different dates all women can come there and benefit.I request this on behalf of all the community women. Thank you ASHA Village name Do you clearly understand what the letter is about? It is a well-intended effort to bring to the notice of the person concerned the conditions that deprive the village women of the ANC’s services and also PAGE 254 42suggests solutions to overcome this problem. But since it is not clear and specific, it does not seem to be effective. The letter can be made more effective if it includes the following details:Before starting to write an application/letter, every writer should ask1. Do I know what I want to say the (the subject)?2. Do I know to whom I am writing? 3. Do I know why I am writing? Read the same letter given below and see the difference between the first letter and the second. To Date ___________(Name'}, {'id': 157, 'text': 'subject)?2. Do I know to whom I am writing? 3. Do I know why I am writing? Read the same letter given below and see the difference between the first letter and the second. To Date ___________(Name and address)___________ ___________ Sub: request to organise MAMTA Day at two locations in the villageDear CDHO (write the name of the concerned person):I am working as ASHA for the village ________ of________ Block. My village has a population of ________ . The houses are scattered across the areas. The ANM regularly comes and organises MAMTA Day. However, it is organised at a place which is not accessible for all the pregnant women. A large number of women living on the other side of the village, are notable to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance. I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the village on different dates. I had a discussion about the same with theANM. She informed me that she needs permission from you. I request you to look into this matter. As an ASHA I take the responsibility to bring all the pregnant women so they have their antenatal check-up. You arewelcome to visit our village. Thank you. Yours sincerely, ASHA (write name of ASHA and the village) PAGE 255 43There are many points to be kept in view in order to convey our messages correctly and precisely. The principles of writing include several do’s anddon’ts Some Do’s1. Address it to the appropriate person2. Check that the letter has a date and reference 3. Keep sentences short 4. Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones5. Do not be vague and mention the reference points for clarity6. Never assume that the reader is aware of the facts and would understand them. 7. Review your writing to add any missing points 8. Write and re-write the letter to get the essence correctly. 9. Explain facts through evidence and examples10.The letter should flow logically from one point to another11.Write with a view to express and not to impress Some Don’ts 1. Avoid unnecessary words 2. Avoid incomplete and irrelevant arguments 3. Do not use ambiguous sentences and universal negatives PAGE 256 44 Each decision that we make has'}, {'id': 158, 'text': 'view to express and not to impress Some Don’ts 1. Avoid unnecessary words 2. Avoid incomplete and irrelevant arguments 3. Do not use ambiguous sentences and universal negatives PAGE 256 44 Each decision that we make has a consequence and a level of impact. Even a small decision has the potential to drastically change the course of our lives.All of us can recall some such decisions taken personally or by others whichhave left an important impact. Decision-making is a learned skill and must bepracticed consciously to strengthen it. As an ASHA you would often require to take some decisions, which will effect the community at large. Hence, it is very important for you to master theskill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. There are some basic steps of decision-making which need to be followed: Define the Problem Look at the situation carefully and examine it from all perspectives to find out the actual problem. For example, you have observed frequent occurence of malaria in the village, affecting the basic health status of the people, especially women andchildren. Malaria seems to be the problem and needs to be eradicated.However, the root problem is drainage water coming out of every housecollecting near residential areas and schools. Decision-Making Skills PAGE 257 45To eradicate malaria completely you need to mobilise people and think of solutions to control the drainage problem. Gather Information Once the problem is identified, collect all the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Use allavailable resources in a way to amicably solve this issue. Think of Alternatives At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meetingand discuss the situation with people with whom you have worked with to collect information regarding the problem. You may also present this in the Gram Sabha. What is important is that people accept and understand theproblem. Later, alternative solutions may be suggested. In participatory decision-making, it is very important that the community owns the problem and feels responsible towards solving it. Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a permanent basis. Choose an Alternative Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative from the various options available. This can'}, {'id': 159, 'text': 'it. Moreover, unless people accept the solution, it cannot be achieved on a permanent basis. Choose an Alternative Part of effective decision-making is the ability to select one good alternative from the various options available. This can be done through consensus of thecommunity and approval, of the authorities. To gain consensus and approvalyou would need to discuss it in the village meetings, the Gram Sabha,Panchayat meetings etc. Before selecting the right alternative, assess all available options. It is important to be practical in taking a decision. Put the Decisions to Work An effective decision is one which can be put into action. Thus,implementation is very important. During this process, keep checking if it ismoving towards the expected solution, and if there is something else whichneeds to be addressed. Nobody is an expert in every skill.They can be mastered only through practice. Hence, decision-making skills can also be sharpened throughexperience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. This is part of the learning process. Accepting responsibility foryour actions is a very important quality and a sign of maturity. PAGE 258 46How to Handle Difficult Situations If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue andreview the options. It is also may be a good idea to adjourn and let peoplethink about it overnight. Description of an Effective Decision zAn effective decision should not leave any unhappy feelingamong group members after the meeting has beenadjourned. zAn effective decision can be translated into reality. It shouldnot be decision impossible to put in action. zAn effective decision can be lived with. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature among persons or groups. zAn effective decision must involve the group enough for the members to implement the decision. PAGE 259 47 Although everyone negotiates informally all the time without even being aware of it, formal negotiation is a skill that can be learned throughexperience and practice. People who negotiate a lot tend to be much moreskilled at it than people who have not participated in any formalnegotiation.

People who negotiate a lot tend to be much moreskilled at it than people who have not participated in any formalnegotiation. Negotiation means dealing with differences between two or more individuals or groups. As an ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these differences to achieve the larger goals of villagehealth programmes. Let us build an understanding of the process ofnegotiation. Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. Because negotiating is an inter-personal process, each negotiating situation is different, and is influenced by each party’s skills, attitudes and style. Weoften look at negotiating as unpleasant because it implies conflict, butnegotiating need not be characterised by bad feelings or angry behavior.Understanding more about the negotiation process allows us to manage ournegotiations with confidence and increases the chance that the outcomes will be positive for both parties. Negotiations need not be confrontational by being offensive, insulting and challenging. In fact, effective negotiation is characterised by groups workingtogether to find a solution, rather than each group trying to WIN at any cost.Negotiation Skills PAGE 260 48Keep in mind that the attitude that you take in a negotiation (e.g, hostile or cooperative) will set the tone for the interaction. If you are confrontational,you will have a fight on your hands. Negotiating is a complex process but definitely one worth mastering. If you keep in mind that you are responsible for the success or failure of the negotiation, and if you follow the tips given here, you will find the process easier. We need to understand that in a successful negotiation everyone wins. The objective should be agreement, not victory or to make the other party orperson feel low. As an ASHA you will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to fulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to negotiate with people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situationwhich requires negotiation. Let us Understand the steps of Successful Negotiation Ask for the other person’s perspective In a negotiating situation'}, {'id': 161, 'text': 'people in authority but with enoughpreparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situationwhich requires negotiation. Let us Understand the steps of Successful Negotiation Ask for the other person’s perspective In a negotiating situation use questions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. Some examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? What are your concerns about what I amsuggesting/asking? When you hear the other person express their needs orconcerns, use appropriate listening responses to make sure you heardcorrectly. State Your needs In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but also why you need it. Prepare options beforehandBefore entering into a negotiating session, prepare some options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not acceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and be prepared to counter the same with an alternative. Do not argueNegotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about trying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation each party tries toprove the other one wrong, no progress is made. Do not waste time in arguing. If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a powerstruggle. PAGE 261 49Consider timing There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on either side, apreoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or tiredness on oneside or the other. The best outcome for almost all negotiations is a win/win situation when both parties walk away with a positive feeling about having achieved their goals. Suggestions for Effective Negotiation While negotiating as an ASHA you must have unlimited patience. Never try tomake the opponent feel low and defeated. Emphathise with the other personto understand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. Approach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right tohave an opinion of'}, {'id': 162, 'text': 'your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. Approach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right tohave an opinion of your own.”You may think that this is being soft and noteffective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. PAGE 262 50 Coordination Skills As an ASHA you are a link between health care services and the community. Therefore, you are expected to regularly coordinate with various stakeholders and the community. Aganwadi worker ANM Sarpanch SHG leader Gram mitrasTBAASHA Youth leaderLeader of milk cooperativeSchool teacher PAGE 263 51You need to be aware of different ways of coordination and how to ensure effective coordination. With effective coordination you will be able to improvethe health status of your community. You need to coordinate with the health facilities to zlearn about decisions taken at the PHC or at the Integrated Child Development officers’ level zshare your concerns regarding the access to health care and nutrition services at the village level zjointly plan health activities to get optimum outcome zplan health camp at the village level and organise MAMTA Day zset up mechanisms to ensure timely referrals for pregnant women There are different ways of coordination. The most common way of coordination is to meet the concerned person regularly and discuss the issueor share information. Another way of coordination is to call a meeting. Youmay need special skills for effective coordination. Let us understand them. Each meeting needs to be productive. A productive meeting is well-planned and result-oriented. Unproductive meetings are too long, vague in purpose, poorly controlled and frustrating. zDecide the agenda of the meeting. Decide who should be called. Invite only those people who can contribute to the meeting and take follow-upactions. zShare the agenda with the concerned persons. This is very critical. At the village level there may be no need to send a written agenda, However you need to clearly orally inform them about the purpose of the meeting andthe points, which need to be discussed. zAt the beginning of the meeting, welcome all the participants.

Jointly fix how much time you need to spend on the meeting. zGive time to each person to share their views. Avoid simultaneousdiscussions. zIf decisions need to be taken, discuss them and articulate the outcome. zIf actions need to be taken after the meeting, list down the actions along with who is responsible for the action, who will support it and a time-line for completion of the action. zAt the end of the meeting prepare a brief report. The report needs tohave following information: PAGE 264 52Documentation of the Meeting Date: T ime: V enue: Purpose of the meetingMembers present during the meeting Absent members1)2) 3) 4)Decisions taken1)2)3) Action to be taken Actions Who will take Who will support it? Date of action? completion of the action Signatures of the members This report needs to be appropriately filed and should be referred to during the next meeting, to review the progress. Some tips to play your role as an effective coordinator of a village meeting zAs an ASHA you have to prepare adequately before meeting. Personally meet the participants beforehand and inform them about the agenda of the meeting. Have clarity on what you are going to discuss. You should also be well aware about the complexity of the issue. zYou should be able to judge what will be the reaction of the otherperson when you discuss the issue with her or him. Be prepared with thecounter-arguments. zWhile having the discussion listen and observe carefully. Any change in a person’s expression communicate a lot. PAGE 265 53zDuring the discussion, if you need to take some on-the-spot decision, be prepared for it. zAt the end of the discussion, briefly articulate the decision taken or theactions enlisted. zWithin a few days after the discussion. Ensure that the decisions are putinto action. zIt is very important that each meeting is documented.

In addition, this module includes the development of speciﬁ c competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.

Role of ASHA ASHA is considered to be a healthcare facilitator and provider of a limited range of healthcare services. Health rights would be integral to her work and would be focused in the areas of community mobilisation to improve health status, access to services, and promote people’s participation in health programmes. PART A Didi, which day is the ANM coming to our village? Didi, they are charging me at the govt hospital and I don’t have the money to pay – can you help me?This is the first day of diarrhoea. Do I have go to the far away town or is there something you can suggest?Objectives of this Session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about:• The role of an ASHA and the activities expected of her. • The health outcomes that her work should result in.• The sets of skills that she needs to be eﬀ ective in. • The records that she has to maintain. • The arrangements for her support and supervision. PAGE 278 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 82. Activities of an ASHA ASHA’s work consists mainly of ﬁ ve activities: 1. Home Visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or ﬁ ve days a week, the ASHA should visit the families living in her allo/g308 ed area. Home visits should take place at least once in a month if not more. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, families will come to her when there is a problem and she would not have to go so o/g286 en to their houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/ village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for'}, {'id': 167, 'text': 'houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/ village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the house, a series of ﬁ ve visits or more becomes essential. 2. A/g308 ending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide immunisation and other services in the village, ASHA will promote a/g308 endance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM services and helps with service delivery. 3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant woman or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort. The visit could also be to a/g308 end a training programme or review meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit, in others, there would be more. 4. Holding village level meeting of women’s groups, and the Village Health and Sanitation Commi/g308 ee (VHSC), for increasing health awareness and to plan health work. 5. Maintain records which would make her more organised and make her work easier, and help her to plan be/g308 er for the health of the people. The ﬁ rst three relate to facilitation or provision of healthcare and the last two are supportive and mobilisational activities. PAGE 279 Part A Being an ASHA 93. Measurable Outcomes of the ASHA Programme In the course of conducting these ﬁ ve activities, the ASHA should ensure the following: Maternal Health 1. That every pregnant woman and her family receive health information for promotion of appropriate healthcare practices – diet, rest and for increased use of services which would focus on care in pregnancy, delivery, postnatal care and family planning services. 2. That every pregnant woman avails of antenatal care and postnatal care at the monthly health worker clinic/VHND. 3. That every family with a pregnant woman has made a plan and is prepared for the event of childbirth. 4. That every couple that needs contraceptive services is counselled on where to avail of the service. Newborn and Child Health 1. That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286'}, {'id': 168, 'text': 'the event of childbirth. 4.

That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o/g286 en if there are problems and receives essential home-based care as well as appropriate referral for the sick newborn. 2. That every family receives the information and support it needs to access immunisation. 3. That all families with children below the age of two years are counselled and supported for – prevention and management of malnutrition and anaemia and for prevention of illness such as malaria, recurrent diarrhoea and respiratory infection. 4. That every child below ﬁ ve years with diarrhoea, fever, Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and worms, brought to her a/g308 ention is counselled on whether referral is immediately required or whether, given the problems of access to a doctor, ﬁ rst contact curative care with home remedies and drugs in her kit, the child can be managed. Disease Control 1. That those individuals noticed during home visits as having chronic cough or blindness or a skin patch in a high leprosy block are referred to the appropriate centre for further check-up. 2. That those prescribed a long course of drugs for tuberculosis or leprosy or surgery for cataract are followed up and encouraged to take the drugs or go for surgery. 3. That those with fever which could be malaria (or kala – azar) have their blood tested to detect the disease and provide appropriate care/referral. 4. That the village and health authorities are alerted to any outbreak of disease she notes during her visits. Note: Each outcome is not a separate activity. They are part of the protocol followed during a single activity _ the home visit. PAGE 280 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 104. Essential Skills for an ASHA The essential skills that an ASHA requires can be classiﬁ ed into six sets.

PAGE 282 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 12For an ASHA to be eﬀ ective in improving people’s access to health services and their health status, an ASHA should: • Have the knowledge and skills to explain the basic maternal and child health services, educate on preventive and promotive aspects of maternal and child health, and provide some measure of immediate relief and advice if there is any illness. • Have the knowledge and skills on other general health issues, especially related to common infections, and be able'}, {'id': 170, 'text': 'maternal and child health, and provide some measure of immediate relief and advice if there is any illness. • Have the knowledge and skills on other general health issues, especially related to common infections, and be able to provide information on access to services and preventive and promotive aspects of healthcare. • Be friendly and polite with people and known among community, and establish rapport with the family during household visits. • Be a special friend to the needy, the marginalised, and the less powerful. • Possess the art of listening.• Have the skill of coordination with Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI), AWW and ANM. • Be competent in conducting meetings in the community.• Be motivated and feel happy and rewarded to help community/serve people. • Have a positive a/g308 itude and be keen to learn new skills.5. Qualities that Make an ASHA Effective PAGE 283 Part A Being an ASHA 136. Conducting a Home Visit The purpose of the home visit is to interact with the family, especially the young women of the house, so as to develop a rapport with them, communicate key health messages, support them for be/g308 er healthcare practices, identify illness early and provide appropriate advice. In particular, homes with a pregnant woman, or a woman who had an abortion or delivery within the last one month, or with any child below two or any malnourished child needs regular home visits. The ﬁ rst step is to gather information to understand the situation. You should ask appropriate initial questions, listen to the woman’s response actively, and do not interrupt the woman while she is speaking. Once the mother has ﬁ nished, ask further questions to clarify what she has said. Then seek more information by asking more detailed and probing questions about the duration of illness and the symptoms. The second step a/g286 er listening is to ﬁ rst praise the mother for how she is managing and reinforce the correct actions she is taking. Then make suggestions to the mother/woman on what further she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information. Repeat the key information to make sure that the mother has understood it. You should ask whether the All Visits (Basic communication skills'}, {'id': 171, 'text': 'she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information.

If necessary, ask the woman to repeat what has been suggested. Discuss further and come to an understanding of what can be done Then the third step, you should discuss and try to correct any misconceptions or rumours. Finally, you should also arrange for follow-up visit or referral.

Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) VHND is a common platform for allowing the people to access the services of the ANM and the male health worker and of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC). It is held at the AWC once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the children, provides antenatal care to pregnant women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. In addition, the ANM provides a basic level of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. The VHND is an occasion for health communication on a number of key health issues. It should be a/g308 ended by the members of the PRI, particularly the women members, pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. The VHND is to be seen as a major mobilisation event to reinforce health messages. You should provide information on the topics given below during the VHND. These topics can be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. Topics for Health Communication during the VHND • Care in pregnancy, including nutrition, importance of antenatal care and danger sign recognition. • Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care. • Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate complementary feeding. • Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking'}, {'id': 173, 'text': 'and danger sign recognition. • Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care. • Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate complementary feeding. • Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and discussion on what actions can be taken locally to improve the situation. • Delaying the age at marriage, postponing the ﬁ rst pregnancy and the need for spacing. • Adolescent health awareness, including nutrition, retention in school till high/higher secondary level, anaemia correction, menstrual hygiene and responsible sexual behaviour. • Prevention of Malaria, TB and other communicable diseases. • Awareness on prevention and seeking care for RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS. • Prevention of tobacco use and alcoholism. What should you do for a successful VHND? • Make a list of the following and ensure their presence during the VHND meeting: /rhombus6 Pregnant women for their antenatal or postnatal care.

The drug kit contains: Paracetomol tablets, Albendazole tablets, Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets, Chloroquine tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), and eye ointment. In addition, the kit may contain condoms and oral contraceptive pills, pregnancy testing kits, and malaria testing kits. The contents of the kit may change depending on the needs of the state. The drug kit is to be re-ﬁ lled on a regular basis from the nearest PHC. To keep a record of consumption of the drugs, and for eﬀ ective re-ﬁ lling and ensuring adequate/timely availability, a drug kit stock card is maintained. This can be completed by the person who reﬁ lls the kit or by you. (Annexe 1: Sample drug kit stock card) PAGE 288 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 189. ASHA Support and Supervision • For ASHA to be eﬀ ective and for her skills to be updated, she needs both on-the-job support and refresher trainings. • Each ASHA will be supported in the ﬁ eld by an ASHA facilitator. • The ASHA facilitator will interact with ASHA at least twice if not thrice a month. • At least one of these interactions will be in the form of a “mentoring” visit to the hamlet where she provides her services. This would focus on mentoring or on-the-job training. • Another one or two interactions would be in a local review meeting. This could be held at Gram Panchayat (GP) level, or at the sector level or even at the block level. • Each of the facilitators will have a clear protocol of activities to follow for the mentoring visit to the ASHAs and for the review meetings. The purpose of these interactions are: a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and information on what work ASHA is doing. b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems they encounter. c For providing'}, {'id': 175, 'text': 'these interactions are: a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and information on what work ASHA is doing. b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems they encounter. c For providing training and refresh or update their knowledge and skills. d For helping ASHAs plan their work.e For building up mutual solidarity and motivation.f For troubleshooting problems, especially as regards payments and addressing grievances. g For reﬁ lls to their drug kit • The Medical Oﬃ cer In-charge of the block PHC/CHC should a/g308 end at least one monthly meeting of all ASHAs in the Primary Health Centre (PHC) area, to review work progress.

Pregnancy Diagnosis Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as possible a/g286 er the ﬁ rst missed period. There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early: • Missed Periods • Pregnancy testing: through use of the Nischay home pregnancy test card /rhombus6 The Nischay test card can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. /rhombus6 The test can be done immediately a/g286 er the missed period. /rhombus6 A positive test means that the woman is pregnant. /rhombus6 The beneﬁ t of early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be registered early by the ANM and start ge/g308 ing antenatal care soon. /rhombus6 A negative test means that the woman is not pregnant. In case she is not pregnant and does not want to get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt a family planning method. /rhombus6 The result of the test should be kept conﬁ dential. Instructions for the use of the Nishcay Kit are in Annexe 2. PART B 1 All knowledge areas in this chapter have been covered in ASHA Module 2. Objectives of this session By the end of the session the ASHA will learn about: • Diagnosing pregnancy using Nischay Kit. • Determining Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up 1. • Identiﬁ cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral. • Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up'}, {'id': 176, 'text': 'of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up 1. • Identiﬁ cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral. • Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up with pregnant women. • Knowledge of safe delivery. • Understand obstetric emergencies and enable appropriate referral for emergencies.• Updating Maternal Health Cards with support from the ANM.

Essential components2 of antenatal care PAGE 294 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 24Where are ANC services provided? The nearest place for ANC services for a woman is at the AWC during the monthly VHND. The pregnant w oman could also go to the Sub-Centre, where the ANM will provide ANC services. ANC services are also provided at the PHC or Community Health Centre (CHC) or district hospital. Identification of problems and danger signs Given below are complications that can occur during the antenatal period for which pregnant w omen must seek treatment in an institution: • Jaundice, high blood pressure, fever with chills, or bleeding • Severe anaemia • Women with protein and sugar in their urine• Swelling of feet, face and hands.Given below are danger signs for which pregnant women must seek delivery in a centre where they can manage complications including those requiring surgery and blood transfusion. • Mothers who had a complication in a previous pregnancy (C section, prolonged labour, stillborn, neonatal death) • Pregnant women with severe anaemia.• Pregnant women having any of the danger signs of the antenatal period which are still persisting at the time of delivery. Some women are to be considered more at risk of developing complications during delivery and therefore, must opt for an institutional delivery. These include: • Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough'}, {'id': 178, 'text': 'institutional delivery. These include: • Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough weight. Key tasks to be undertaken during ANC • List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest families, and in any sections which tend to get le/g286 out, e.g. women from SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main village, or in hamlets that fall between villages and newly migrant women. • Educate pregnant women about care in pregnancy, especially on the importance of increased nutrition, rest, and complete ANC services. PAGE 295 25 Maternal HealthPart B• Emphasise the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet during pregnancy. The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of cereals, pulses (including beans and nuts), vegetables including greens, milk, eggs, meat and ﬁ sh. If possible, the family should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. Meat and nuts are especially good for anaemic women. You should explain to the mother and family that no foods should be forbidden during pregnancy. • See when ANC is due for each check-up and remind them appropriately. • Escort pregnant woman to VHND where they are hesitant or need such support. • Ensure that all components of ANC are delivered.• Ensure that the Maternal Card is updated. Planning for a Safe Delivery You should • Know how to calculate the EDD and communicate this to the pregnant woman. • Know which institutions in the area provide different levels of care and establish linkages with providers there. • At least once before delivery, take the pregnant woman to this centre and introduce her to the providers. • Know what transport is available _ whether funded by the state or other private means _ that is easily accessible and affordable and how to call on it when the need arises. • Assist all pregnant women and families to prepare plans for birth: including identifying funding sources should money be required at short notice.

This is a method of planning in advance by the pregnant mother and her family for a safe and comfortable deliv ery and for care a/g286 er delivery. You should help every family make this plan in consultation with the ANM. What are the choices available to the mother? 1. If there are any danger signs or complications: Identify the nearest institution (CHC/District Hospital) which has the staﬀ and equipment to provide Comprehensiv e Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC), and counsel the mother and the family to go there. 2. If there are no complications: Counsel the mother to go to the PHC which is open 24 X 7, where there is a team of doctors and nurses or ANMs to conduct the delivery and provide care for the mother and newborn. These institutions can manage some complications and transfer immediately to a higher facility if complications requiring surgery or blood transfusion develop. The list of such institutions can be obtained from the ANM. The place should be clean and safe and friendly and have a skilled nurse or doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a/g286 er delivery. 3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7'}, {'id': 180, 'text': 'doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a/g286 er delivery. 3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7 PHC or if it is too far away: Advise the mother could go the Sub-Centre, provided it is accredited as a delivery centre, which means the ANM has been trained as a Skilled Birth A/g308 endant (SBA), and is available, and there are minimum facilities for delivery. 4. If there are no complications or not a high risk case for developing complications and the mother and family insist on delivering at home, despite counselling: You could work with the ANM to enable a delivery by SBA. This should be agreed to only if you are sure that the family can organise transport and funds at very short notice. The SBA should be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the onset of labour at the home/Sub-Centre and should able to stay through the process of labour and for a few hours a/g286 erwards. A team of two or three women with experience in a/g308 ending at labour would be helpful. What does a birth preparedness plan contain? (See Annexe-3 for format for individual plan) When should a birth preparedness plan be readied? It should be ready as early as possible a/g286 er conﬁ rming the pregnancy, and in consultation with the family (husband, mother-in-law, or other decision makers). You should review the plan in the third trimester (a/g286 er seventh month) with the family and the ANM. At this time, the choice of institution and the transport should be ﬁ nalised.

For some women, family circumstances and beliefs make even going to the sub-centre diffi cult. I will then get the ANM to come to her house, and will assist in the preparations needed, after counselling that a safe delivery in this situation may not always be possible. If I go to the PHC which is open 24 hours, I will be cared for and can rest for two days. Also, if there is any surgery needed, they can rush me to the big hospital quickly. Woman’s choice I will also need to ensure that I have an escort, maybe the ASHA, to accompany me, and that someone is taking care of the children and things at home. If danger signs or complications develop before the delivery, I will need to go to the big hospital straight away, but I hope that does not happen. If she has no complications, I will counsel her to go to the 24X7 PHC, and for this too, I must ensure that transport arrangements are made in time.

The chances of a mother having a delivery before term, or even dying are higher among mothers with severe anaemia. In order to make sure that all women have good iron stores, all pregnant women should be given iron tablets, even if they are not anaemic. Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test, which measures the amount of a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb). Low levels of Hb mean that the woman has anaemia (see box below). The test should be performed during the antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal 7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia If a woman'}, {'id': 182, 'text': 'antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemia More than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal 7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemia Less than 7 g/dl Severe anaemia If a woman during the time of pregnancy has Hb level below 11g/dl, she is considered to be suﬀ ering from anaemia. Common symptoms of severe anaemia include:• Very pale tongue• Weakness• General swelling in body. For women who do not have anaemia (Hb more than 11 g/dl) The pregnant woman should take one tablet of IFA every day for at least 100 days (prophylactic dose), starting a/g286 er the ﬁ rst trimester, at least 14-16 weeks of gestation to prevent anaemia. This dosage regimen is to be repeated again for three months a/g286 er the delivery. If a woman is found to be anaemic: • The woman should be given two IFA tablets per day for three months. This means that a pregnant w oman with anaemia needs to take at least 200 tablets of IF A. Besides taking IFA tablets, you should encourage the pregnant woman, where possible, to increase her dietary intake of iron-rich food. • The Hb level should be estimated again a/g286 er one month. If the level increases, you should tell the woman to continue with two tablets of IFA daily until the Hb comes to normal. If the Hb does not rise in spite of taking IFA tablets, in the prescribed dose, you should refer the woman to the nearest facility that is equipped to manage complications in pregnancy. • You should refer women with severe anaemia immediately to the nearest PHC/CHC/DH for further treatment. Such women may need injections or blood transfusions. PAGE 299 29 Maternal HealthPart B• The dosage regimen of two IFA tablets per day should be repeated for three months post-partum also. Counselling pregnant women on anaemia: • Encourage women to take iron-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, whole pulses, ragi, jaggery, meat and liver. This advice should be discussed with family and ﬁ nalised based on the family situation. • Encourage the woman, where possible, to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption'}, {'id': 183, 'text': 'and ﬁ nalised based on the family situation. • Encourage the woman, where possible, to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption of iron. • Counsel the women on the necessity of taking IFA, the dangers associated with anaemia, and inform the women that these side-eﬀ ects are common and not serious, and will reduce over time. • IFA tablets must be taken regularly, preferably early in the morning on an empty stomach. If the woman has nausea and pain in abdomen, she may take the tablets a/g286 er meals or at night. This will avoid nausea. • Dispel the myths and misconceptions related to IFA and convince the woman about the importance of taking it. An example of a common myth is that the consumption of IFA may aﬀ ect baby’s complexion. • Many women do not take IFA tablets regularly due to some common side-eﬀ ects such as nausea, constipation and black stools. Tell women not to worry about passing black stool while consuming IFA. It is normal. • In case of constipation, the woman should drink more water and add roughage (plenty of green leafy vegetables) to her diet. • IFA tablets should not be consumed with tea, coﬀ ee, milk or calcium tablet as it reduces the absorption of iron. • IFA tablets may make the woman feel less tired than before. However, despite feeling be/g308 er, she should not stop taking the tablets and must complete the course as advised by the healthcare provider. • Ask the woman to return to you if she has problem taking IFA tablets. How do you get the IFA?The IFA tablets are part of your drug kit. Try to ensure that you always have enough stock. Either your facilitator or a person appointed by the MO of the PHC is given the responsibility of reﬁ lls for the drug kit. IFA tablets are also made available at VHND or in any health facility.

Care during Delivery Observation of the delivery process was not part of previous ASHA training modules. In this module, you will be oriented to normal delivery processes and newborn care, and also develop the skills for recording the various events and pregnancy outcome. Even though you are not required to manage delivery, you may have to help if the delivery starts during transport. This knowledge also gives you conﬁ dence to know more about this. You should try and stay with the pregnant woman through delivery in the institution or at home, and post-partum period. You could therefore also be a ‘Birth Companion’ to the mother during the stay at the institution. This is not a compulsion, but a desirable service. Alternatively, a close relative could also be the birth companion. PAGE 305 35 Maternal HealthPart BBefore Delivery The delivery room should be cleaned before the delivery. If the delivery is happening at home, you should facilitate a clean delivery space. Immediately after birth, if the baby remains naked, it may become cold. Hence, baby clothes should be kept ready before delivery. 1st Stage of labour Starts from the beginning of pain until the mouth of the womb is fully open. This happens inside and cannot be seen. The bag of water also breaks at the end of this stage. The fluid is usually clear but may be yellow or green or red. If green, it indicates infection. This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours in the first pregnancy. May take much less time in subsequent pregnancies. Illustration (a) - drawing of side view of a pregnant woman.

Points for you to pay attention to if you are also present at the time of delivery in the institution: • It is not necessary to shave the area, or give an enema to the mother at the time of delivery. • All deliveries do not require an episiotomy (cut at the perineal site). • Fundal pressure (pushing on the abdomen) should not be applied. • You should be alert if injections are being given to hasten the delivery process. Such injections can cause a baby who is still born, birth of a baby who is unable to breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should give the injection.'}, {'id': 188, 'text': 'breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery.

The very top of the head comes ﬁ rst, then the eyes, nose and mouth (d). While in most babies, the eyes are facing the ﬂ oor; sometimes they are born looking towards the ceiling. When the baby’s head is out, it turns to one side (e) and the shoulders and rest of the body are delivered (f). Once out, the baby will cry. Delivery of Placenta The cord will be connected to the placenta which is still inside the womb. PAGE 308 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 386. Post-Partum Care Post-partum care is the period a/g286 er delivery of the placenta up to six weeks a/g286 er birth.3 3 Post-partum care has been covered in ASHA Module 2.Tasks for you to undertake during this period • Conducting home visits to mother and child: Mothers and newborns need care from the time of birth to six weeks a/g286 er the delivery. The recommendation for postnatal care is to visit on the 3rd day a/g286 er delivery, on the 7th day and at the end of six weeks, i.e on the 42nd day. For the newborn, the recommendation is to visit on the 3rd day, 7th day, 14th day, 21st day and 28th day. A/g286 er this period, visits are still needed once in two weeks till the child is two years old for nutrition advice, immunisation advice, and support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, for illness prevention and just to remain in touch. • In eﬀ ect therefore, you would need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day, 21st, and 28th day, and a/g286 er that, once every two weeks starting from the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is'}, {'id': 189, 'text': 'need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day, 21st, and 28th day, and a/g286 er that, once every two weeks starting from the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is born at home, then of course you should be there at birth or at least visit her within the ﬁ rst hour. • Advice to the mother during these visits: /rhombus6 Assess the mother for signs of complications (see below for the list of complications) and ensure appropriate referral. /rhombus6 Encourage her to rest for at least six weeks a/g286 er childbirth. Families should be counselled to allow this. /rhombus6 Encourage her to eat more food than usual. She can eat any kind of food but high protein foods – pulses and legumes (nuts are especially useful), foods of animal source. She should also drink plenty of ﬂ uids. Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Schedule of visits and tasks to be performed at each visit.• Understand the possible complications of the post-partum period.• Be able to identify the complications and refer appropriately. PAGE 309 39 Maternal HealthPart B/rhombus6 Encourage and support for exclusive breastfeeding (Please see section on Breastfeeding-Part C, Section 3) /rhombus6 Discuss with the mother the need for contraceptive services. Caution her on the risk of unprotected sex and the high chances of conceiving again. You should counsel her on the importance of spacing the next child birth for her own health and that of the baby. You should help her in making the choice of the method of family planning, whether spacing or limiting. Complications during the post-partum period Some women can develop complications a/g286 er the childbirth. The symptoms of these major complications are: 1. Excessive bleeding: Ask the mother if the bleeding is heavy. O/g286 en this is quite obvious, but sometimes it may be diﬃ cult to judge. If the woman is using more than ﬁ ve pads a day or more than one thick cloth in a day, she is having heavy bleeding. You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications.

You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications. You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding. Referral is most urgent. Even the delay of a few minutes can make a diﬀ erence. 2. Puerperal Sepsis (Infections): Ask if the discharge is foul smelling. If the answer is yes, then suspect infection. Fever, chills and pain in abdomen along with the foul smell make infections even more likely. You should measure temperature to conﬁ rm fever. Referral is required since the mother needs antibiotics. Referral on the same day is advisable. 3. Convulsions with or without swelling of face and hands, severe headache, and blurred vision: Such patients need immediate referral. If ANM is available within 15 minutes, she can stabilise the patient before referral. 4. Anaemia: You should check if the mother is pale and enable the mother to get her blood Hb status checked (for management of anaemia in the post-partum period, please see Section 3). 5. Breast engorgement and Infection: (Part C: Newborn Health) PAGE 310 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 406. Perineal Swelling and Infection: If the mother has a small tear at the opening of her vagina (or has had stitches during the delivery), she should keep the area clean. She can apply cloth dipped in hot water, twice a day and hold it to her genitals. This will give her relief and help the healing. If there is fever, she should be referred to the PHC or CHC. A tablet of paracetomol would help both the pain and the fever. 7. Post-Partum Mood Changes: Some women may suﬀ er from mood changes a/g286 er delivery. They need counselling and family support. The changes usually disappear a/g286 er a week or so. If the changes become severe then referral is required.

Care of the Baby at the time of Delivery Many babies die immediately after birth due to asphyxia. In case of home delivery, when mild labour pains start, you can manage asphyxiated babies by removing mucus and can initiate respiration with the help of the instruments you have. You should encourage the mother to start breastfeeding immediately after the delivery, as this will help in quick delivery of placenta and minimises bleeding. Starting to breastfeed immediately after the birth makes the baby stronger. Chances of the baby’s death and getting sick are higher among the babies born before time (pre-term) and in LBW babies, (Weight less than 2500 gm increases the risk and below 1800 gm, the risk is considered very high.) PAGE 314 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 442. Schedule of Home Visits for the care of the Newborn The purpose of these visits is to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, discourage harmful practices such as bo/g308 le feeds, early baths, giving other substances by mouth, and to identify early signs of sepsis or other illnesses in the newborn. • The newborn requires a visit immediately a/g286 er birth (or within the ﬁ rst 24 hours), and on Day 2, if the baby is born at home. • If the baby is born at a facility, persuade and support the mother to stay for at least 48 hours, and therefore, the ﬁ rst two visits are taken care of in the institution. However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the'}, {'id': 192, 'text': 'least 48 hours, and therefore, the ﬁ rst two visits are taken care of in the institution.

Additional visits are needed for newborn babies which are LBW, born before term and are sick. 3. Examining the Newborn at Birth Steps for you to take “just after” the baby is born if the baby is born at home, or if you are present at the delivery, 1. Ask the mother about/observe the ﬂ uid a/g286 er the waters break. 2. If the ﬂ uid is yellow/green, as soon as the head is seen (even before delivery of complete baby), clean the mouth of the baby with gauze piece. 3. As soon as the baby is born, note the time of birth and start counting time. 4. Observation of baby at birth or within the ﬁ rst 30 seconds and at 5 minutes a/g286 er birth for movement of limbs, breathing and crying. The ﬁ gure below will enable the assessment of whether the newborn should be recorded as a live or still birth. All six have to be “No” to declare a still birth. Even if one is “yes” the baby should be declared as live birth. 5. If there is no cry or a weak cry, if there is no breathing or weak breathing or gasping, this condition is called Asphyxia. If the baby is asphyxiated (does not breathe at birth), and there is no doctor or nurse, you should try to help and this skill is taught to you, in Module 7. However, in many such newborns, your eﬀ orts may not make enough diﬀ erence and you should not feel bad or blame yourself for this. (Management of asphyxia will be taught in Module 7).

The so/g286 white substance with which the newborn is covered is actually protective and should not be rubbed oﬀ . /rhombus6 The baby should be kept close to mother’s chest and abdomen. /rhombus6 The baby should be wrapped in several layers of clothing/woollen clothing depending upon the season. /rhombus6 The room should be warm enough for an adult to feel just uncomfortable. The room should be free from strong wind. 8. You should weigh the newborn and decide whether the baby is normal or LBW. 9. Determine whether the baby is term or pre-term. 10. Measure newborn temperature. First examination of newborn a. You should conduct the first examination within first 24 hours of delivery and look for the following:• Whether the baby has any abnormality such as curved limbs, jaundice, bump on head, cle/g286 lip. • How the baby is suckling at the breast. PAGE 317 Part C Newborn Health 47• Whether the baby has loose limbs. • Listen to the cry of the baby. • Provide care of eyes. If there is pus/purulent discharge from eyes and no doctor or nurse available, apply tetracycline ointment. Even for normal eyes, tetracycline is used as a preventive, so even in doubt as to whether it is pus, it could be given. • Keep umbilical cord dry and clean. b. General precautions the family must take The newborn is delicate and can easily fall sick if the family and mother are not careful. Y ou should explain some general precautions that the family should take. • Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not be bathed until the ﬁ rst seven days, many families'}, {'id': 194, 'text': 'not careful. Y ou should explain some general precautions that the family should take. • Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not be bathed until the ﬁ rst seven days, many families would like to bathe the baby on the ﬁ rst or second day. For a normal baby, if the family insists, the baby could be bathed a/g286 er the second day. But in the case of LBW baby, you must insist on their waiting for at least seven days. You should explain that bathing the baby and leaving it wet or exposed may cause it to get cold and fall sick. Thus, it is be/g308 er to wipe the baby with a warm wet cloth and dry the baby immediately. • Keep the baby away from people who are sick. • People who are sick with cold, cough, fever, skin infection, diarrhoea, etc. should not hold the baby or come in close contact with the baby. • The newborn baby should not be taken to places where there are other sick children. • The newborn baby should also not be taken to places where there are large gatherings of people. c.

Eye care Skill checklist for applying eye ointment If a newborn has pus discharging from its ey es y ou can put antibiotic ointment in the baby’s eyes or a capsule which is available in the market. How to put antibiotic ointment:• Gently pull the baby’s lower eyelid down.• Squeeze a thin line of ointment moving from the inside corner to the outside of the eye. • Do not touch the baby’s eye with the tip of the tube. If the tube touches the babies eyes, it shouldn’t be used again. • If the eyes are swollen with pus, then put the ointment two times a day for 5 days. Remember: The usual bathroom scales cannot reliably record small diﬀ erences in weights. That is why bathroom scales cannot accurately record newborn weight and it is not advisable to use these for weighing newborns. PAGE 320 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 504.

O/g286 en mothers are worried that they are inexperienced and lack the conﬁ dence. Many women do not breastfeed successfully because they do not get good advice, support and encouragement. • If she says something that you do not agree with, do not say ‘that is wrong’. Do not make her feel bad or stupid. You can repeat what she says (For example, ‘I hear you saying that you think you don’t have enough milk....’ Ask her why she thinks so. Listen to what she is saying and why). • A/g286 er you assess the breastfeeding, you should check the baby’s weight gain. • Give advice in simple and clear language. • Make sure the mother understands what you are saying.• Have her repeat what she will try to do. g.

PAGE 323 Part C Newborn Health 53Managing Common Breastfeeding Problems Sore nipples Causes: poor latch-on or positioning at breast Management • Improve attachment and/or position. • Continue breastfeeding (reduce engorgement if present). • Build mother’s confidence. • Advise her to wash breast once a day; not to use soap for this. • Put a little breast milk on nipples after feeding is finished (to lubricate the nipple) and air-dry. • Wear loose clothing. • If nipples are very red, shiny, flaky, itchy, and their condition does not get better with above treatment, it may be fungus infection. Apply gentian violet paint to nipples after each breastfeed for five days. If the condition does not improve, refer to a doctor. Inverted nipples Sometimes the nipple will retract in to the breast, and can be checked even during pregnancy. The best treatment is to encourage the mother to gently pull out the nipple and roll it, several times in a day. Not enough milk Causes: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding; infrequent feeding; giving fluids other than breast milk; mother’s anxiety, exhaustion, insecurity; inadequate family support. Management • Decide whether there is enough milk or not: /rhombus6 Does the baby pass urine six times or more each day? /rhombus6 Has the baby gained sufficient weight? (During the 1st week there is usually a small weight loss, after that a newborn should gain 150- 200 gm per week.) /rhombus6 Is the baby satisfied after feeds? • Re-assure mother. • If there is not enough milk, have the baby feed more often. • Check breastfeed to observe mother attachment and positioning of the mother and baby. • Encourage rest.

If it is not possible, ask the mother to express some milk herself. • If breasts are red and hard, continue to feed often. Use warm compresses and gently massage breasts towards nipple. Take mother’s temperature. If she has fever, mother should visit the doctor. She should continue to breastfeed (from both sides) even if she is taking antibiotics. Expressing milk by hand 1. Wash hands with soap and water. 2. Place a warm compress on the breast for a few minutes if desired.3. Gently massage the breast starting from the chest moving toward the nipple; do this in a circle (near the underarm, and then to the bo/g308 om of the breast etc.), so that all parts of the breast are massaged. 4. Lean forward and support the bo/g308 om of the breast with one hand.5. Hold the areola between thumb and two ﬁ ngers of other hand.

Babies have diﬃ culty maintaining their temperature at birth and in the ﬁ rst day of life.They come out wet, and lose heat quickly. If they get cold, they use up energy, and can become sick. LBW and pre-term babies are at greater risk of ge/g308 ing cold. When and why do most newborns get cold?Most newborns lose heat in ﬁ rst minute a/g286 er delivery. They are born wet. If they are le/g286 wet and naked, they lose a lot of heat to the air. A newborn baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn'}, {'id': 202, 'text': 'baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn baby is not properly dried, wrapped, and its head is not kept covered, it can lose 2 to 4 degree Celsius within 10-20 minutes. Example: If the baby’s temperature was 97.7 degree Fahrenheit (36.5 degree Celsius) (normal temperature) at the time of birth and if there was a loss of 2.7 degree Fahrenheit because the baby was not properly dried and covered, the body temperature will become 95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), which is below normal. What is the term for a situation when a baby’s temperature falls below normal?When a baby has a temperature below normal, it suﬀ ers from hypothermia. What happens to a baby with hypothermia?A baby who is cold, and has a low temperature (hypothermia) suﬀ ers from: • Decreased ability to suckle at the breast, leading to poor feeding and weakness.5. Keeping the Newborn Warm Objectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Identify the newborn whose body temperature is less than normal and whose body temperature is more than normal. • Teach mothers how to keep the newborns warm. • Teach mothers how to re-warm cold babies.• Teach mothers how to control newborn temperature in hot weather. • Learn to take the temperature. PAGE 328 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 58• Increased susceptibility to infections. • Increased risk of death, especially in LBW and pre-term babies. How can you tell if a baby is hypothermic? • The early sign is cold feet. • Then, the body becomes cold. • The best method is to measure the baby’s body temperature. (This skill has already been taught to you) How to keep newborns warm • Before delivery, warm up the room (warm enough for adults).• Immediately a/g286 er delivery, dry the baby. • Put a cap on the baby since a lot of heat could be lost though its head.• Place in skin-to-skin contact with mother.• Cover or put clothes on the baby, wrap it up with clean cloth, and place it'}, {'id': 203, 'text': 'cap on the baby since a lot of heat could be lost though its head.• Place in skin-to-skin contact with mother.• Cover or put clothes on the baby, wrap it up with clean cloth, and place it close to its mother. • Initiate early breastfeeding.• Bathing for newborns: /rhombus6 It is best to wait until the second day to bathe the baby. One should wait seven days in case of LBW baby. /rhombus6 If the family insists on bathing the ﬁ rst day, please ask them to delay for at least six hours to give the baby time to adjust with its new environment. /rhombus6 For small and pre-term babies, do not give a bath until the baby gains weight (this could be few weeks) and weight of baby become 2,000 gm. • To keep a small baby clean, you can give a light oil massage but making sure that the room is warm and the baby is not le/g286 uncovered for more than 10 minutes. DO NOT pour oil into any oriﬁ ce, like the nose or ears at any time. • Keep baby loosely clothed and wrapped. • If it is very warm outside, make sure the baby is not too heavily clothed and wrapped; the baby can also get too hot. • Wherever possible, insist on referral to a facility that is managing sick newborns. If this is not immediately possible, begin the following steps:Warming PAGE 329 Part C Newborn Health 59How to re-warm a baby getting cold? <97 degree Fahrenheit (36.1 degree Celsius) or too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius) • Increase the room temperature. • Remove any wet or cold blankets and clothes. • Hold the baby with its skin next to its mother’s skin (skin-to-skin contact) and place a warmed cloth (not too hot to avoid burns) on its back or chest. As this cloth cools down, replace it with another warmed one, and repeat until the baby is warmer. Continue until the baby’s temperature reaches the normal range. • Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother. • Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the'}, {'id': 204, 'text': 'Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother. • Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the blood glucose level. /rhombus6 A common problem in hypothermic babies. If a baby is too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), follow the above advice, and • Place skin-to-skin, and once the baby is a little warmer, then clothe baby and place in a bed pre- warmed with warm clothes, or a hot stone or hot water bottle. (Remove these articles before putting baby on the bed.) • In an institutional delivery, there should be a newborn corner available with a radiant warmer, or some other suitable heating arrangement where the newborn baby can be kept. PAGE 330 ASHA Module 6 Simple Skills that Save Lives 606. Management of fever in newborn A baby has fever if the temperature is above 99 degree Fahrenheit (37.2 degree Celsius). In the case of high body temperature of the baby during summer, verify in the following manner whether this is due to the body being overdressed or does it really have fever: • Unwrap the baby and take oﬀ its cap.• Ventilate the room too to cool the baby. • Ask the mother to start breastfeeding. • If there is a source of extra heat (like a ﬁ re) in the room, put it out.• Wait for 30 minutes and take the temperature once again. If the baby’s temperature returns to normal, explain to the mother that in very warm weather, the baby does not have to kept covered with additional cloth or kept wrapped. If the temperature is still above normal a/g286 er the above measures have been taken, refer the baby for treatment.

You should encourage parents and other family members to spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the child. Such children eat and absorb food better. 5Accesstohealthservices ◆Accesstohealthservicesmakesforprompttreatmentofillness.Ontheveryﬁrstdayoftheillness,ifyouhelpthemotherdecideonwhetheritisaminorillnessforwhichhomeremedywouldbeadequate,ortobereﬀreredtoadoctor,suchadecisionwouldsavelives.Earlytreatmentwouldpreventmalnutrition. ◆Accesstocontraceptiveservicesisimportant.Iftheageofmotherislessthan19,orthegapbetweentwochildrenislessthanthreeyears,thereisamuchhigherchanceofthechildrenbeingmalnourished. 6Accesstoanganwadiservices ◆Theanganwadiprovidesafoodsupplementforthechilduptotheageof5.Thiscouldbeacookedmeal,orintheformoftake–homerations.Malnourishedchildrenaretobegivenadditionalfoodsupplements.Forchildrenbelowtheageoftwo,take–homerations P a r t A Child Health & Nutrition 9aretobegiven.Evenpregnantwomenandlactatingmothersuptosixmonthsareentitledtogetfoodsupplementsintheanganwadicentres. ◆Weighingthebabyandinformingthefamilyofthelevelofmalnutritionisanotherimportantanganwadiservice. ◆TheanganwadiisalsothesitewheretheVillageHealthandNutritionDay(VHND)isconducted.TheANMvisitseverymonthandthechildisgivenimmunisation,VitaminA,paediatricirontablets,OralRehydrationSalts(ORS)packetsordrugsneededforillnessmanagement. Note Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.

She is being breastfed and only this month was started on complementary food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations from there. Her immunisation is on schedule. Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has no odema, but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite. He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. His immunisation schedule is complete.
