### Conversation Stage Management
#### Follow-up Questions Stage
```python
def generate_followup_question(main_symptom, screening_info, previous_questions, relevant_quote):
    prompt = f"""Generate a single, concise follow-up question about: "{main_symptom}"
    Consider this screening information: {screening_info}
    The question should be different from these previous questions: {previous_questions}
    Base your question on this relevant information: {relevant_quote['text']}
    Provide only the question, nothing else."""
    return groqCall(prompt)
```

#### Test Generation Stage
```python
def generate_test(main_symptom, screening_info, symptom_info, relevant_quote, previous_tests):
    prompt = f"""Suggest a simple test for: "{main_symptom}"
    Consider this screening information: {screening_info}
    And these symptoms: {symptom_info}
    The test should be different from these previous tests: {previous_tests}
    Base your suggestion on this relevant information: {relevant_quote['text']}
    Provide the test description and instructions."""
    return groqCall(prompt)
```

#### Advice Formation Stage
```python
def generate_advice(main_symptom, screening_info, symptom_info, test_results, relevant_quote):
    prompt = f"""Provide 3 pieces of advice for: "{main_symptom}"
    Consider this screening information: {screening_info}
    These symptoms: {symptom_info}
    And these test results: {test_results}
    Base your advice on this relevant information: {relevant_quote['text']}"""
    return groqCall(prompt)
```
